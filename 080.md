# Omission of Critical Data in fetching in the exchange rate and ETH price in borrowLiquidation.liquidationType1()

### Summary

Commenting out `uint128 ethPrice` when trying to fetch the exchange rate and ETH price in [liquidationType1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L187) can lead to inconsistencies in the liquidation process.

### Root Cause

When `liquidationType1` is used for liquidation, during the workflow, it gets the `exchange rate` and `eth price`. which is really useful in the liquidation process. But the issue is that, the actual code doesn't do exactly what the comment above the snippet says.
```solidity
        // Get the exchange rate and ETH price
        (uint128 exchangeRate /*uint128 ethPrice*/, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));
```
As seen, the uint128 ethPrice is commented out, hence only the `exchangeRate` is fetched.

In `CDS.withdraw:301` the `ethPrice` is [fetched](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L301-L302)

### Impact

This omission would lead to the collateral's true value (in USD or another stable unit) may be underestimated or overestimated.

### Mitigation

The code should be corrected to retrieve and use both the exchange rate and the ETH price to ensure consistent behavior.
```solidity
(uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));
```
