# `min/max` Answer check is not done in for Chainlink oracles

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause


When reading from Chainlink feeds validation is not done for `min/max` answers even though such oracles are used.
Eg: [ETH/USD chainlink feed in optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9) has min and max value set

```solidity
            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
```

> Chainlink Price Checks: Issues related to minAnswer and maxAnswer checks on Chainlink's Price Feeds are considered medium only if the Watson explicitly mentions the price feeds (e.g. USDC/ETH) that require this check.

This is the feed https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x13e3Ee699D1909E989722E753853AE30b17e08c5#code and the controller which pushes the price https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. If the price feed `ETH/USD` returns incorrect data based on that borrowing contract liquidate a collateral position.
2. When user deposit collateral if the price feed `ETH/USD` returns incorrect data based on that calculation of ratio is incorrect and `vaultValue` and `cdsPoolValue` is set with incorrect value.
3. In the deposit collateral if the price feed returns incorrect data the calculateOptionPrice is calculated incorrect and user will pay less or more option fees.
4. In the deposit of collateral when user mint usda this amount is calculate based on the price feed `ETH/USD` so the mint of usda is incorrect for a user
5. overall every feature of the protocol that is directly related to this price feed is vulnerable.


### Impact


Insufficient validation of oracle can lead to the acceptance of bad data that the entire calculation process that is used directly price feed within the protocol is to be affected.

### Mitigation

Check for the min/max Answer on the feeds.
