# `downsideProtected` is incorrectly included when calculating the new cumulative value

### Summary

When depositing into or withdrawing from CDS the `downsideProtected`, which has already been deducted from the protocol is included in the calculations of the new cumulative value. This is incorrect as the `downsideProtected` is no longer in the protocol and the cumulative value will be lower than it should be. Thus, depositors will likely get higher profits. 

### Root Cause

In CDS when depositing or withdrawing `downsideProtected` is included in the cumulative value calculations:

### Attack Path

1. `downsideProtected` is 1000 USD, and it has already been burned from the Treasury.

2. A user deposits 100 USDT into CDS and when calculating the cumulative value and cumulative value sign at the time of the deposit the 1000 USD is included in the calculations:
`value = uint128((_amount * vaultBal * priceDiff * 1e6) / (PRECISION * (totalCdsDepositedAmount + 1000)));` (+ 1000 because of downsideProtected)

As the `downsideProtected` is a part of `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, which is a denominator, the cumulative value at the time of the deposit will be lower than it should be.

3. Now after the value has been calculated the `downsideProtected` is deducted from `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and is reset to 0:

4. Therefore, if the depositor were to immediately withdraw, the withdraw cumulative value will become higher than the deposit cumulative value even though no changes have occured. The cumulative value will now be:
`value = uint128((_amount * vaultBal * priceDiff * 1e6) / (PRECISION * (totalCdsDepositedAmount - 1000 + 100)));` (- 1000 because the downside protected has been deducted, + 100 because of the deposit)

5. Essentially, the cumulative value at a withdrawal will be immediately higher than the cumulative value at a deposit, due to the `downsideProtected` being included when calculating the deposit cumulative value even though it has already been burned from the Treasury. As a result of the deposit cumulative value being higher than it should be, the depositors will receive higher profits than they should be able to as the size of the profits are dependent on the difference of the deposit and withdrawal cumulative values:

### Impact

Depositors can earn immediate profits, due to the cumulative value being incorrectly calculated at the time of their deposits.

### PoC

### Mitigation

When calculating the new cumulative value in withdrawals and deposits, downside protected must first be deducted from the `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.
