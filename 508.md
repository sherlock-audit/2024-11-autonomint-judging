# `calculateCollateralToReturn()` is going to give the user much less ETH if the prices goes drastically up

### Summary

`calculateCollateralToReturn()` is going to underflow if ETH price goes drastically up, which will return in the impossibility of actually withdrawing the deposited ETH via `borrowing::withdraw()`


### Root Cause

The root cause is an incorrect logic in accounting how much of the collateral the user can withdraw if the borrowing health is > 10_000, which is going to be the case as I explain here

`calculateCollateralToReturn()` as the name implies calculated the amount of ETH that the user can withdraw during the invocation of `borrowing::withdraw()`, but if ETH price rises, it would cause an underflow [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L489).

If ETH rises from 3350 (writing this at 26.12.2024) to 6700 and we've deposited exactly 1 ETH, it will give us `depositedAmountvalue` to be equal to 0.5 ETH. 
`params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains()` is used for calculating the amount to be returned and if we've made the strike price to be 10% above 3350 when we deposited (so 3685 or roughly 3700 usd per ETH), it will give us back 0.9 ETH.

This will make 0.5 ETH + 0.9 ETH to be equal to 1.4 ETH and then it would cause an underflow [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L489) due to trying to subtract 1 ETH with 1.4 ETH

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Price of ETH has to increase significantly: 80-100% which is fully plausible in a bull market.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits 1 ETH via `borrowing::depositTokens()`
2. Price of ETH rises from 3350 to 6700 indicating a 100% increase against the dollar
3. User decides to repay his loan and withdraw his funds via `borrowing::withdraw()`
4. During the calculation in regards to how much of his ETH collateral can user get instantly, but due to the incorrect logic, it will revert
5. User can't get his deposited collateral back and has stucked funds

### Impact

User can't withdraw his collateral due to the underflow caused by incorrect logic

### Mitigation

Create a different logic/mechanism for the calculation of withdrawing ETH
