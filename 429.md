# Lack of functionality to update the owner or requireApproval in `multiSign.sol`

### Summary

The missing function to update an owner and requiredApprovals in [multiSign.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L20-L90), causes a permanent owner and requiredApprovals 

### Root Cause

In `multiSign.sol` there is no function to update an owner or requiredApprovals
```solidity
   function initialize(
        address[] memory _owners,
        uint64 _requiredApprovals
    ) public initializer {
        // initialize the owner
        __Ownable_init(msg.sender);
        //Initialize the proxy
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        uint8 _noOfOwners = uint8(_owners.length);
        // Check whether the number of owners is not a zero
        require(_noOfOwners > 0, "Owners required");
        maxOwners = 10;
        // Check whether the owners reached maximum limit
        require( _noOfOwners <= maxOwners,"Number of owners should be below maximum owners limit");
        // Check whether the required approvals are lessthan or equal to the number of owners
        require(_requiredApprovals > 0 && _requiredApprovals <= _noOfOwners,"Invalid number of required approvals");

        for (uint64 i; i < _noOfOwners; i++) {
            address _owner = _owners[i];
            // Check the owner address is non zero
            require(_owner != address(0), "Invalid owner");
            // Check, the same owner address is not repeated
            require(!isOwner[_owner], "Duplicate owner");

            isOwner[_owner] = true;
            owners.push(_owner);
        }

        requiredApprovals = _requiredApprovals;
        noOfOwners = _noOfOwners;
    }
```
When one or more owner accounts cannot be accessed or are compromised, the contract cannot change the owner, because the owner are permanent.

### Impact
When one or more owner accounts cannot be accessed or are compromised, the contract cannot change the owner, because the owner and `requiredApprovals` are permanent.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add function to update owner or requiredApprovals
