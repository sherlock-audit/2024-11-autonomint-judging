# Lack of access control on the borrowing.redeemYields function

***Summary:***
The borrowing.redeemYields function lacks access control in order to prevent anyone from calling this function.  I lacks an access control modifier and a require statement.

***POC:***
The borrowing.redeemYields function requires an onlyOwner access modifier; as well as a require statement that checks if the sender is indeed the user parameter. Without these validations, the borrowing.redeemYields function is open season for all malicious actors.

***Mitigation:***
```diff
    function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
+    ) public onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
-    ) public returns (uint256) {

+    require(msg.sender == user, "Wrong user");
        // Call redeemYields function in Borrow Library
        return (
            BorrowLib.redeemYields(
                user,
                aBondAmount,
                address(usda),
                address(abond),
                address(treasury),
                address(this)
            )
        );
    }
```
In the corrected code I have added access controll that ensure only the owner can call thus function. I have also added a require statement that checks if the user is indeed the sender.
