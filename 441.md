### PoC

**Textual PoC:**

there is two type liquidation[type1, type2] and in type2 user's collateral convert to sETH and then swap to sUSD and then will be deposited in synthetix but as we can see amount will be passed to `wrapper::mint` and then amount will be passed to exchange function but this assumption isn't correct because sETH received from mint function can be less than expected and this causes liquidate transaction will be reverted

https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/7e483a008c68b87f71ec8764d7cee6737ea16889/contracts/EtherWrapper.sol#L211

as we can see there is two important factor first one is fee and second one is currentCapacity which have effect on mint amount and hence mint amount can be less than expected amount

### Impact

`Borrowing::liquidate` will be reverted

### Mitigation

Consider to get sETH balance before and after mint function
