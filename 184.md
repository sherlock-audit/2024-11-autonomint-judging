# Sending cross-chain wrsETH we unwrap it before sending it, but dont wrap it when its received

### Summary
When transferring `wrsETH` cross-chain we unwrap it before sending it but don't wrap it when its received.

### Root Cause
When destination chain receives request for collateral/token transfers to requesting chain it processes it in the `_lzReceive()` function in [GlobalVariables.sol#L587-L593](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L587-L593) contract:
```solidity
            // Get the funds from treasury, since the sender is global variables contract
            treasury.transferFundsToGlobal([
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.weETHToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.rsETHToSend,
                    oappData.oftTransferData.tokensToSend
                ]
            );
```

When transferring `wrsETH`, the process involves withdrawing it from the treasury and sending it to the `GlobalVariables.sol` contract via the `transferFundsToGlobal()` function.

However, the function unwraps `wrsETH` into `rsETH`. On the receiving chain, the collateral is not wrapped back into `wrsETH`. This could lead to potential DoS issues in the future or incorrect tracking of available reserves.

```solidity
    function transferFundsToGlobal(uint256[4] memory transferAmounts) external onlyCoreContracts {
        // Loop through the array to transfer all amounts
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            // Transfer only if the amount is greater than zero
            if (transferAmounts[i] > 0) {
                address assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName((i == 3 ? 4 : i) + 1));
                // Transfer tokens if the index not equal to 0, since index 0 is ETH
                if (i != 0) {
                    if (i == 2) {
                        if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) {
                            revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
                        }
@>>                     IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(
                            borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]
                        );
                        assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
                    }
                    bool success = IERC20(assetAddress).transfer(msg.sender, transferAmounts[i]);
                    if (!success) revert Treasury_TransferFailed();
                } else {
                    // Transfer ETH to global variable contract
                    (bool sent,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: transferAmounts[i]}("");
                    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

We are calling withdraw on the `wrsETH` asset with  the `rsETH` address appropriately, they have to be set correctly by admin:
```solidity
    /// @dev Withdraw altRseth tokens from wrsETH
    /// @param asset The address of the token to withdraw
    /// @param _amount The amount of tokens to withdraw
    function withdraw(address asset, uint256 _amount) external {
        _withdraw(asset, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```

Reference for transfer:
```solidity
                if (rsETHAmount != 0) {
@>>                 interfaces.treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH, address(interfaces.cds), rsETHAmount);
@>>                bool sent = IERC20(interfaces.borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH)).transferFrom(
                        address(interfaces.treasury), msg.sender, rsETHAmount
                    ); // transfer amount to msg.sender
                    if (!sent) revert CDSInterface.CDS_TransferFailed(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH);
                }
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
This could lead to DoS problems in the future or wrong tracking of available reserves.
 ( _for example when we try to transfer that funds to a dCDS user withdrawing or back to the other chain, but we either don't have enough of it to transfer or enough of it to unwrap_ ) 
Also if the other chain needs that collateral it will try to transfer it later, but it won't be able to probably, as it will try to transfer the requested `wrsETH`, but it received `rsETH`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Use deterministic approach for transferring collateral assets, if we would unwrap some assets we should account for that and handle it appropriately.
