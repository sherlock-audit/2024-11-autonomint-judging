# Absence of Validation for Chainlink Oracle's `Min/Max` Price Bounds

## Summary

The Chainlink Oracle implementation fails to account for `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` boundaries, potentially allowing the protocol to use incorrect price data during extreme market events.`

## Vulnerability Details

The Chainlink Oracle retrieves price data using `latestRoundData` but does not validate whether the returned price lies within the predefined `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` range. Chainlink feeds may employ these boundaries to ensure price reliability and mitigate the effects of anomalies or extreme market movements.

For example, an aggregator feed may have well-defined `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values to restrict valid price ranges. However, the current implementation neglects this feature and could inadvertently use a price outside of these bounds.

Consider the following code snippet:
[MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83)
```js
function _price(
        address underlying
    ) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
    // more code
    AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);  
    (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();  
    if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {  
        return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6))); 
    }
    // more code
```
Here, `the price_` returned by the oracle is directly used without validating it against the oracle's `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`.

Here is an example of aggregrator contract on optimism for an in-scope token i.e. `weETH` that still uses `min/max` price checks:

## Impact

During extreme market conditions, the protocol may use stale capped prices from Chainlink feeds (like `weETH/ETH`) instead of actual market prices, leading to incorrect liquidations or allowing users to maintain undercollateralized positions, directly risking protocol solvency.

## Recommendation

Modify the implementation to include a check that validates the returned price against the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values. If the price lies outside these bounds, the protocol should handle the anomaly appropriately.
