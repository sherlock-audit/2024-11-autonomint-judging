# Lack of Stale Price Check in `MasterPriceOracle` Contract

### Summary

The `MasterPriceOracle` contract integrates multiple price oracles to determine the USD value and exchange rates for collateral tokens (e.g., ETH) used in the borrowing mechanism. The contract interacts with oracles like Redstone and Chainlink to fetch live pricing data for various assets.
The contract fetches asset prices using trusted oracles (Redstone and Chainlink) without performing an explicit check on whether the returned price data is stale. Although Chainlink's `latestRoundData` provides a timestamp, this is not verified within the contract code to determine if the price is fresh enough for critical decision-making (e.g., determining collateral ratios or initiating liquidations). This opens the contract to the risk of utilizing outdated prices that may not reflect the current market conditions. Also, there is no check for staleness in Redstone oracle.

```Solidity
    function _price(
        address underlying
    ) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
        // if there is no oracles found revert
        if (oracles[underlying] == address(0))
            revert("Price oracle not found for this underlying token address.");

        // get oracles based on chain
        if(block.chainid == 31337 || block.chainid == 34443){ //?  31337 is used for testing
            // for we are using redstone oracles
            IRedstoneOracle oracle = IRedstoneOracle(oracles[underlying]);
            // updating the underlying to address supported by redstone, based on underlying type
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH]) {
                underlying = 0x028227c4dd1e5419d11Bb6fa6e661920c519D4F5;
            } else if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH]) {
                underlying = 0x4186BFC76E2E237523CBC30FD220FE055156b41F;
            } else if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                underlying = address(0);
            }

            // get the price of the underlying
            uint256 priceInUsd = oracle.priceOf(underlying);
            // get the eth price
            uint256 priceOfNativeInUsd = oracle.priceOfETH();
            // return the exchange rate of the underlying to the ETH and eth price
            return (uint128((priceInUsd * 1e18) / priceOfNativeInUsd), uint128(priceOfNativeInUsd / 1e16));
        } else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
            return (0, 0);
        }
    }
```
`_price(address underlying)`: This function fetches the price of an asset using the appropriate oracle. It integrates logic for two types of oracles (Redstone for some chains, Chainlink for others).
Price Retrieval: For each underlying asset, this function fetches the asset price from either the `IRedstoneOracle` or the `AggregatorV3Interface` (for Chainlink oracles), but lacks any explicit checks for stale prices or recent price updates in both these oracles.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The absence of stale price checks in the contract may lead to the following impacts:

* Financial Loss: The protocol may trigger actions (e.g., liquidations) based on outdated or incorrect pricing, causing either over-collateralization (protecting borrowers from liquidations) or under-collateralization (leading to systemic risk).
* Security Exploits: Adversaries could exploit timing differences or delays in price updates to manipulate collateral values and increase profits at the expense of other protocol participants.
* Incorrect Borrowing Terms: Without fresh pricing, borrowers could be given loans against assets that no longer have adequate value, leading to default risk or liquidity issues for lenders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Chainlink provides an updatedAt timestamp, which could be used to verify the recency of price data:

```Solidity
(, int256 price_, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();

// Check if the price is stale (for example, older than 30 minutes)
if (block.timestamp - updatedAt > 30 minutes) {
    revert("Price data is stale");
}
```

Also, make necessary changes for Redstone oracle.
