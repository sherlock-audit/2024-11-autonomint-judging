# Adversary could always keep the USDT reserves as 0 by using flashloan attack on the redeemUSDT function

### Summary
The `redeemUSDT()` function in CDS allows users to exchange USDA for USDT. However, there is no limit on how much an individual user can withdraw, and the function is not restricted to dCDS depositors. This means an adversary could use a flash loan to drain all the USDT, consistently keeping the USDT reserves empty.

### Root Cause
`redeemUSDT()` just checks if we have the USDa balance we want to exchange [reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L511-L524):
```solidity
    function redeemUSDT(
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 burnedUSDaInRedeem,
        uint128 usdaAmount,
        uint64 usdaPrice,
        uint64 usdtPrice
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        if (usdaAmount == 0) revert CDSInterface.CDS_NeedsMoreThanZero();
@>>     if (interfaces.usda.balanceOf(msg.sender) < usdaAmount) {
            revert CDSInterface.CDS_Insufficient_USDa_Balance();
        }
        // Increment burnedUSDaInRedeem
        burnedUSDaInRedeem += usdaAmount;
        IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory omniChainData = interfaces.globalVariables.getOmniChainData();
        omniChainData.burnedUSDaInRedeem += usdaAmount; //
        // burn usda
        bool transfer = interfaces.usda.burnFromUser(msg.sender, usdaAmount);
        if (!transfer) revert CDSInterface.CDS_TransferFailed(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa);
        // calculate the USDT USDa ratio
       uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);

        interfaces.treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.TUSDT, address(interfaces.cds), usdtAmount);
        // Transfer usdt to user
@>>     bool success = interfaces.usdt.transferFrom(address(interfaces.treasury), msg.sender, usdtAmount);
        if (!success) revert CDSInterface.CDS_TransferFailed(IBorrowing.AssetName.TUSDT);
        interfaces.globalVariables.setOmniChainData(omniChainData);
        return burnedUSDaInRedeem;
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Adversary takes ETH flashloan.
2. Adversary swaps the ETH for USDA on a Uniswap or other liquidity pool.
3. Adversary calls `redeemUSDT()` in CDS contract and gets all the USDT out, by depositing USDA
4. Adversary sells USDT for ETH to repay the loan.
5. Done. For small amount of fees paid for the flashloan, the adversary just emptied the whole USDT reserve of the treasury.

### Impact
This limits the ability of the protocol to control the peg stability mechanisms. The USDT redeemability was added exactly for this particular reason:

> 5.Immediate re-deemability - Users can re-deem USDa to get USDT immediately in case the price falls below $1 

### Mitigation
Consider adding limit on how much can be withdrawn per transaction, as well as per user. Also, consider limiting the function only to dCDS depositors.
