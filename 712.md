# Bad actors can manipulate USDT/USDA exchange rates in `CDS.redeemUSDT()` to redeem an unlimited amount of USDT until Treasury is drained

### Summary

The ability to manually pass in the prices of USDT and USDA while lacking price validation in `CDSLib.redeemUSDT()` can allow bad actors to redeem an unlimited amount of USDT from treasury until fully drained, as the attackers can pass arbitrary price values to maximize their exchange rate when redeeming USDA for USDT.

### Root Cause

In [CDS.sol:506](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506-L545), the `redeemUSDT()` function accepts user-provided price parameters without any validation in the subsequent `redeemUST()` function used in CDSLib.sol:

```solidity
 function redeemUSDT(
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 burnedUSDaInRedeem,
        uint128 usdaAmount,
        uint64 usdaPrice,
        uint64 usdtPrice
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        // CHeck the usdaAmount is non zero
        if (usdaAmount == 0) revert CDSInterface.CDS_NeedsMoreThanZero();
        // Check the user has enough usda balance
        if (interfaces.usda.balanceOf(msg.sender) < usdaAmount)
            revert CDSInterface.CDS_Insufficient_USDa_Balance();
        // Increment burnedUSDaInRedeem
        burnedUSDaInRedeem += usdaAmount;
        // GET the omnichain data
        IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory omniChainData = interfaces.globalVariables.getOmniChainData();
        // Increment burnedUSDaInRedeem
        omniChainData.burnedUSDaInRedeem += usdaAmount;
        // burn usda
        bool transfer = interfaces.usda.burnFromUser(msg.sender, usdaAmount);
        if (!transfer) revert CDSInterface.CDS_TransferFailed(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa);
        // calculate the USDT USDa ratio
        uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);

        interfaces.treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.TUSDT, address(interfaces.cds), usdtAmount);
        // Transfer usdt to user
        bool success = interfaces.usdt.transferFrom(
            address(interfaces.treasury),
            msg.sender,
            usdtAmount
        );
        if (!success) revert CDSInterface.CDS_TransferFailed(IBorrowing.AssetName.TUSDT);

        interfaces.globalVariables.setOmniChainData(omniChainData);

        return burnedUSDaInRedeem;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Bad Actor needs to have USDA tokens to redeem
2. Treasury contract needs to have a large enough USDT balance

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains USDA tokens

2. Attacker calls redeemUSDT() with manipulated prices:
- Sets high usdaPrice, e.g "10" which would be 10 USDT per USDA 
- Sets low usdtPrice, e.g "0.1" 

Function calculates USDT amount using manipulated prices:
```solidity
uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```
4. Attacker receives a proportionally larger balance of USDT based on manipulated exchange rate, i.e based on the example prices, the adversary would get 5000 USDT in exchange for 50 USDA.

5. Can be repeated or done in 1 transaction to completely drain Treasury of its entire USDT balance.

### Impact

Autonomint suffers direct loss of USDT reserves/USDT user deposits as attackers can redeem more USDT than their USDA should be worth by manipulating the exchange rate. The size of loss is only limited by the protocol's Treasury USDT balance and attacker's USDA balance.

### PoC

See attack path

### Mitigation

Use the already implemented Oracle that fetches the price of ETH to fetch and plug in the prices of USDT and USDA respectively, instead of allowing the values to be passed in as arguments in the redeemUSDT function.
