# withdrawing a deposit does not check if optionFees have expired

### Summary
Currently we don't check if the options for collateral protection/hedging have expired, during a withdraw. This means that borrower can withdraw and still get protection from the `dCDS` depositors, even though he hasn't paid for renewal.

### Root Cause
No check if X time have passed since `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp`, which means that the `renewOptions() `function would have no incentive to be called by the borrowers and used to pay the optionFees for the next 30 days, as we allow the borrower to withdraw with the protection, even if they haven't paid.

Reference to withdraw function in `borrower.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L281-L310

   function withdraw(...) external returns (IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Result memory) {
        // Get omnichain data
        IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory omniChainData = interfaces.globalVariables.getOmniChainData();
        IGlobalVariables.CollateralData memory collateralData =
            interfaces.globalVariables.getOmniChainCollateralData(depositDetail.assetName);

        // Check if user amount in the Index has been liquidated or not
        if (depositDetail.liquidated) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyLiquidated();

        // check if withdrawed in depositDetail in borrowing of msg.seader is false or not
        if (!depositDetail.withdrawed) {
            // Calculate the borrowingHealth
            uint128 borrowingHealth = calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, params.ethPrice);

            // Check the health is grater thsn 0.8
            if (borrowingHealth < 8000) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();

            // Calculate th borrower's debt
            uint256 borrowerDebt = calculateDebtAmount(depositDetail.normalizedAmount, params.lastCumulativeRate);
@>>         uint128 downsideProtected = calculateDownsideProtected(
                depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, params.ethPrice, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit
            ); //downsideProtected is in USD precision 1e6

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
- OptionFees have expired, thus borrower should no longer have protection
- However the borrower could still withdraw and not lose collateral, as it will be covered by dCDS depositors.

### Impact
We are allowing borrower to use protection and save potential downside loss, even when the borrower haven't paid renewal option fees.

### Mitigation
If borrower is able to withdraw his position, he should not gain the benefits of `dCDS` depositors covering potential losses, that should be enforced.
