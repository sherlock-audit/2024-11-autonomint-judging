# Lack of access control in `MultiSig::executeSetterFunction` allows DoS of setter functions in `Borrowing` and `CDS`

### Summary

The `MultiSig::executeSetterFunction` is a function that is called by all setter functions in `Borrowing` and `CDS` to check if the set of that particular variable is approved by the `MultiSig::owners`. Within the same execution, `MultiSig::executeSetterFunction` sets to `false` all the approvals that were set to `true` and then returns `true`, only if the minimum `requiredApprovals` was reached. 

A malicious user could call  `MultiSig::executeSetterFunction` when there are enough approvals before any of the contracts that use the `MultiSig` function to DoS these functions. Additionally, all owners will be required to approve the set function again.

### Root Cause

In `MultiSig::executeSetterFunction`, no access control is implemented:
[multiSign.sol#L304-L314](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304-L314)
```solidity
    function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
        require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- Enough approvals done for a setting function

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- Attacker waits until all approvals on a specific function are made
- Attacker directly calls the `MultiSig::executeSetterFunction` with the function that was approved
- Neither `Borrowing` nor `CDS` can set the value and all admin approvals get revoked in `MultiSig`.

### Impact

DoS of setting functions in `Borrowing` and `CDS`.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add access control to the function so only the `Borrowing` and `CDS` contracts can call it.
