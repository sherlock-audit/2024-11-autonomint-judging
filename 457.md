# `redeemYields` must be pauseable

### Summary


The `multiSign` contract is not able to pause the `redeemYields` function, which allows users to purchase ABOND from the market and withdraw ETH from external protocols. This bypasses the protocol's emergency pause mechanism.

Based on the [documenation](https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/stablecoin-peg-stability#peg-stabilization-modules): users can purchase ABOND from the market and deposit it into our protocol. 


### Root Cause


All the core functionality of the protocol have `whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions())` modifier that can be paused by the `multiSign` contract.

The following functions are pauseable and can be disabled.

- `CDS:redeemUSDT`
- `CDS:deposit`
- `CDS:withdraw`
- `borrowing:depositTokens`
- `borrowing:withdraw`
- `borrowing:liquidate`


However, `redeemYields` lacks such a pause mechanism, enabling users to withdraw ETH from the protocol even during an emergency pause.

```solidity
    function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        // Call redeemYields function in Borrow Library
        return (
            BorrowLib.redeemYields(
                user,
                aBondAmount,
                address(usda),
                address(abond),
                address(treasury),
                address(this)
            )
        );
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions


1. The protocol is in an emergency state, and all other functionalities are paused.
2. A user has ABOND deposited in the protocol and withdraw ETH.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. During a market crisis or emergency pause, user purchase the ABOND tokens from the market.
2. The user calls the `redeemYields` function while the protocol is paused.
3. The function proceeds to burn USDA, withdraw ETH from the external protocol, and burn ABOND.
4. Sell the ETH for USDa on secondary markets this increases the circulating supply of USDa, further destabilizing the peg.
5. The malicious user successfully withdraws ETH and destabilizing the peg despite the emergency pause.

### Mitigation



Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `redeemYields` function.
