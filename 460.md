# Improper pyth fee in executeOrdersInSynthetix

### Summary

In executeOrdersInSynthetix(), we take 1 wei as the pyth update fee. The fee is not enough and the transaction will be reverted because the pyth update fee is not enough.

### Root Cause

In [borrowLiquidation.sol:381](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L381-L386), the admin will execute the order. We will pay some fee to synthetix, because we need to use these fees to update the pyth price.

The problem is that:
1. We only transfer 1 wei to the synthetix. 1 wei is not enough to update the pyth price. This will cause revert.
2. Funtion executeOrdersInSynthetix() in borrowLiquidation is not payable. If there is no Ether in borrowLiquidation, this transaction will be reverted.

```solidity
    function executeOrdersInSynthetix(
        bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData
    ) external onlyBorrowingContract {
        synthetixPerpsV2.executeOffchainDelayedOrder{value: 1}(address(this), priceUpdateData);
    }
```
```solidity
    function executeOffchainDelayedOrder(address account, bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData) external payable onlyProxy {
        // important!: order of the account, not the sender!
        DelayedOrder memory order = marketState.delayedOrders(account);
        // check that a previous order exists
        require(order.sizeDelta != 0, "no previous order");

        require(order.isOffchain, "use onchain method");

        // update price feed (this is payable)
        _perpsV2ExchangeRate().updatePythPrice.value(msg.value)(messageSender, priceUpdateData);

```

### Impact

1. We only transfer 1 wei to the synthetix. 1 wei is not enough to update the pyth price. This will cause revert.
2. Funtion executeOrdersInSynthetix() in borrowLiquidation is not payable. If there is no Ether in borrowLiquidation, this transaction will be reverted. This may be workaround via deposit a little bit more Ether via liquidateBorrowPosition() function.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

1. When admin triggers executeOrdersInSynthetix() in borrowing.sol, the admin should transfer some ether as the pyth price update fee.
2. The msg.value for executeOffchainDelayedOrder() should be pre-calculated via pyth interface.
