# Incorrect Debt Repayment Without Considering Downside Protection

### Summary

The withdraw function in the borrowing contract fails to account for the borrower's downside protection when repaying the debt. This results in borrowers paying more than they should, when asset prices dropped.

### Root Cause

The downside protection value calculated in calculateDownsideProtected is not considered when determining the borrower's debt repayment amount.  User pays whole debt amount even though there is a downside protection.

```solidity
  function withdraw(
  
    ) external returns (IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Result memory) {

            // Check the health is grater thsn 0.8
            if (borrowingHealth < 8000) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();

            uint256 borrowerDebt = calculateDebtAmount(depositDetail.normalizedAmount, params.lastCumulativeRate);
            uint128 downsideProtected = calculateDownsideProtected(
                            depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                            params.ethPrice,
                            depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit
                        );

          // Assuming collateral is not eth
         if (depositDetail.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
                } else {
                    discountedCollateral = 0;
                }

                // Calculate the USDa to burn
                uint256 burnValue = depositDetail.borrowedAmount - discountedCollateral;

                bool success = interfaces.usda.burnFromUser(msg.sender, burnValue);
                if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

                if (downsideProtected > 0) {
                    omniChainData.downsideProtected += downsideProtected;
                }

                //Transfer the remaining USDa to the treasury
                bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
                    (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral
                );
```

Example Calculation:
Initial Borrow Amount: 1000 USDA
Total Debt :  1050 USDA
Downside Protection: 100 USDA
Discounted Collateral: 0 USDA

Burn Amount = borrowedAmount - discountedCollateral = 1000 - 0 = 1000
Transfer Amount = (borrowerDebt - borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral = 1050 - 1000 + 0 = 50
Total Paid: 1050 USDA (ignoring downside protection)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Colleteral price should have dropped from initial deposit price
2. User should pay the debt before it drops more than %20
