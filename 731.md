# Adversary can infinitely inflate ethBacked values across multiple secondary wallets through ABond transfers allowing a redemption of much higher yields than should have been possible

### Summary

A flaw in ABond's transfer mechanism where sender's ethBacked remains unchanged as long as abond tokens are non zero, and the adjustement of ethBacked for the recepient can cause yield drainage from the external protocol as adversary can infinitely inflate ethBacked values through transfers between multiple wallets while maintaining high ethBacked ratios

### Root Cause

In [`Colors.sol:20`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/Colors.sol#L20-L34), the transfer mechanism only updates the receiver's ethBacked while preserving the sender's ethBacked.

The flaw starts through Abond_Token.sol:

```solidity
function transfer(
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        // check the input params are non zero
        require(msg.sender != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User");

        // get the sender and receiver state
        State memory fromState = userStates[msg.sender];
        State memory toState = userStates[to];

        // check sender has enough abond to transfer
        require(fromState.aBondBalance >= value, "Insufficient aBond balance");

        // update receiver state
        toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value));
        userStates[to] = toState;

        // update sender state
        fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
        userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;

        // transfer abond
        super.transfer(to, value);
        return true;
    }
```

Continued in Colors.sol:

```solidity
function _credit(
        State memory _fromState,
        State memory _toState,
        uint128 _amount
    ) internal pure returns(State memory){

        // find the average cumulatie rate
        _toState.cumulativeRate = _calculateCumulativeRate(_amount, _toState.aBondBalance, _fromState.cumulativeRate, _toState.cumulativeRate);
        // find the eth backed
        _toState.ethBacked = _calculateEthBacked(_amount, _toState.aBondBalance, _fromState.ethBacked, _toState.ethBacked);
        // increment abond balance
        _toState.aBondBalance += _amount;

        return _toState;
    }
```

```solidity
/**
     * @dev calculates eth backed
     * @param _balanceA abond balance of user A or same user with previous abond balance 
     * @param _balanceB abond balance of user B or same user with new abond balance  
     * @param _ethBackedA eth backed of user A or same user with previous eth backed 
     * @param _ethBackedB eth backed of user B or same user with new eth backed
     */
    function _calculateEthBacked(uint128 _balanceA, uint128 _balanceB, uint128 _ethBackedA, uint128 _ethBackedB) internal pure returns(uint128){
        // If balance A is zero revert
        if (_balanceA == 0) revert InsufficientBalance();
        uint128 currentEthBacked;
        currentEthBacked = ((_balanceA * _ethBackedA)+(_balanceB * _ethBackedB))/(_balanceA + _balanceB); 
        return currentEthBacked;
    }
```

The calculation in its current implementation is flawed as it adjusts via weighted average adjusting the ethBacked of the recipient not taking into account the sender's ethBacked, which creates an opportunity to inflate ethBacked an infinite amount of times through multiple wallets that only need to maintain a holding of atleast 1 ABOND token throughout this whole endevour, until calling borrowing.redeemYields() is extremely profitable even with a relatively small Abond token burn.
    
    

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Adversary needs one wallet with a significant ETH deposit to obtain ABonds with high ethBacked
2. Additionally adversary's wallets need minimal ETH deposits to establish initial positions and to get back abond tokens and an relatively low ethBacked value in the yields pool.
3. Protocol must have yield-generating deposits in Ionic

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker sets up multiple wallets with minimal deposits (e.g., 0.2 ETH each) to get low ethBacked values
2. Main wallet deposits significant ETH (e.g., 20 ETH) to get high ethBacked value (10 ETH)
3. Main wallet transfers most ABonds to secondary wallets while keeping minimal balance
4. Secondary wallets receive elevated ethBacked values through weighted average calculation
5. Each secondary wallet can now claim yields based on inflated ethBacked values
6. Process can be repeated across multiple wallet pairs


### Impact

The protocol suffers significant yield extraction because:
1. Secondary wallets receive artificially high ethBacked values relative to their actual deposits
2. Main wallet maintains high ethBacked despite transferring out most ABonds
3. Yields are calculated directly based on ethBacked values without deposit verification
4. Attack can be scaled across multiple wallets
5. Cost to main wallet is minimal compared to cumulative gains across secondary wallets

### PoC

### Proof of Concept

The vulnerability allows attackers to artificially elevate the ethBacked values of secondary wallets to drain yields. Here's how:

Initial Setup:
1. Wallet1 deposits 10 ETH and receives 3000 ABonds
   - Wallet1: 3000 ABonds, ethBacked = 5 ETH (50% to Ionic)

2. Wallet2 deposits 0.2 ETH and receives 60 ABonds
   - Wallet2: 60 ABonds, ethBacked = 0.1 ETH (50% to Ionic)

Attack Execution:

Step 1 - Wallet1 transfers 2940 ABonds to Wallet2 (keeping 60 ABonds):
Using _calculateEthBacked formula:
newEthBacked = ((transferAmount * sender.ethBacked) + (receiver.balance * receiver.ethBacked)) / (transferAmount + receiver.balance)
= ((2940 * 5) + (60 * 0.1)) / (2940 + 60) = 4.9 ETH

After transfer:
- Wallet1: 60 ABonds, ethBacked = 5 ETH (unchanged due to flaw)
- Wallet2: 3000 ABonds, ethBacked = 4.9 ETH

Impact:
- Wallet2's ethBacked increased from 0.1 ETH to 4.9 ETH
- Wallet2 can now claim yields as if it had deposited 4.9 ETH instead of 0.1 ETH
- When calling `Borrowing.redeemYields()`, the inflated ethBacked value directly increases the yield amount since:
  `depositedAmount = (aBondAmount * userState.ethBacked) / PRECISION`

This allows the attacker to:
1. Set up multiple low-deposit wallets
2. Use a high-value wallet to elevate their ethBacked values via transfers
3. Extract inflated yields using the artificially elevated ethBacked values
4. The cost to the "donor" wallet is extremely small compared to the gains across multiple recipient wallets e.g:

The adversary returns the Abonds to original wallet:
-Using _calculateEthBacked formula:
newEthBacked = ((transferAmount * sender.ethBacked) + (receiver.balance * receiver.ethBacked)) / (transferAmount + receiver.balance)
= ((2940 * 5) + (60 * 5)) / (2940 + 60) = 4.9 ETH (Which results in a 0.1 ethBacked loss, which is miniscule compared to the 0.1 to 4.9 ethBacked gained for wallet 2)

The vulnerability stems from:
1. Sender's ethBacked remaining unchanged during transfers
2. Receiver getting a weighted average ethBacked that can be much higher than their actual contribution
3. Direct use of ethBacked in yield calculations without verification against actual deposits

### Mitigation

- Update sender's ethBacked proportionally when transferring ABonds
- Implement maximum ethBacked-to-deposit ratio checks
- Consider revising the weighted average calculation to prevent ethBacked elevation
