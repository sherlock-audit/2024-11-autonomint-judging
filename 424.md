# Users pay interest more than expected

### Summary

users pay interest more than expected 

### Root Cause

```solidity
borrowDebt = normalizedAmount * lastCumulativeRate
normalizedAmount = tokensToMint / lastCumulativeRate
interest = borrowDebt - borrowedAmount
```
as we can see the protocol uses delta between lastCumulativeRate at depositing time and lastCumulativeRate at withdrawal time to compute interest but lastCumulativeRate will be updated after computing lastCumulativeRate hence users pay interest more than expected

### PoC

**Textual PoC:**
Let's assume ratePerSec is 2
1- userA deposits 1 ETH and gets 800 usda as loan when lastCumulativeRate is 64
2- userB deposits 1 ETH and gets 800 usda as loan 5 seconds after userA
normalizedAmount for userB = 800 / 64 = 12.5
3-userB withdraws her/his collateral after 5 seconds
as we can see userB pay interest for loan with duration 10 seconds instead of 5 seconds because of computing normalizedAmount with stale cumulative rate    

### Impact

loss of funds for users

### Mitigation

Consider to update lastCumulativeRate before computing normalizedAmount
