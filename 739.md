# Nonce is not stored in `CDS:withdraw()`, allowing `excessProfitCumulativeValue` signatures to be reused

### Summary

[excessProfitCumulativeValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L285) is calculated on the backend and depends on the specific circunstances, being crucial to ensure that cds withdrawals due to withdraw too much USDa. However, the nonce sent in the signature is not stored in the contract, which will allow attackers to reuse signatures with the lowest possible  `excessProfitCumulativeValue` and steal from the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `CDS.sol:285`, the nonce is not stored and checked.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Cds depositor withdraws, with a certain, lower, `excessProfitCumulativeValue`.
2. Second cds depositor reuses the first signature, instead of using the correct `excessProfitCumulativeValue`, getting more cds amount in return.

### Impact

The protocol suffers USDa losses that were allocated to other cds depositors, treasury so on.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Store the nonce and ensure the next nonce is used in the signature.
