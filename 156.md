# Attacker Can Exponentially Increase Cumulative Rate in `Borrowing` contract

### Summary

The `calculateCumulativeRate()` function in the `Borrowing` contract lacks proper access control, making it publicly accessible to any user. This unrestricted access allows anyone to call the function repeatedly, which can result in an exponential increase in the `lastCumulativeRate`.

### Root Cause

In `Borrowing.sol`, the function `calculateCumulativeRate()` lacks access control, allowing any user to call it repeatedly. 

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
@>      uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

This results in an exponential increase in `lastCumulativeRate` because the function calculates the rate based on the time interval since `lastEventTime`, which is not updated within the function. 

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;


        // If there is no borrowers in the protocol
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            // current cumulative rate is same as ratePeSec
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Find time interval between last event and now
@>          uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            //calculate cumulative rate
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

Without updating `lastEventTime`, the calculation uses the same initial timestamp and updated `lastCumulativeRate`, causing the cumulative rate to grow exponentially with each call.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker notices that the `calculateCumulativeRate()` function is publicly accessible and lacks access control.
2. The attacker repeatedly calls the `calculateCumulativeRate()` function. Each call uses the same `lastEventTime`, leading to the calculation of the cumulative rate based on an increasing `lastCumulativeRate`.
3. As the function is called continuously, the `lastCumulativeRate` grows exponentially due to the compounding effect of the rate calculation.
4. This manipulation can lead to incorrect interest calculations, affecting borrowers

### Impact

This issue can cause exponential growth in the `lastCumulativeRate`, resulting in inaccurate interest calculations. Borrowers may face unexpectedly high interest charges, which can destabilize the protocol's financial operations. The manipulation could lead to financial discrepancies.

This issue will affect following functions

1. `normalizedAmount` calculation in `Borrowing.depositToken()`[[`BorrowLib.deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L750)]
2. `borrowerDebt` calculation in `Borrowing.withDraw()`[[`BorrowLib.withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L825)]
3.  `borrowerDebt` calculation in `Borrowing.liquidate()`[[`BorrowLib.liquidationType1()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L205)]

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Function Visibility:** Change the visibility of the `calculateCumulativeRate()` function to private or internal to restrict access and prevent unauthorized calls.

2. **Update lastEventTime:** Ensure `lastEventTime` is updated within the `calculateCumulativeRate()` function to accurately reflect the time of the last calculation, preventing exponential growth in the cumulative rate.
