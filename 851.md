# ETH Insufficiency in `BorrowLiquidation` Contract Leads to Transaction Failures During Type 2 Liquidation, Blocking Type 2 Liquidation

### Summary
The `BorrowLiquidation` contract fails to hold the required ETH amount before calling the `weth.deposit` function during type 2 liquidation, leading to transaction failures.

### Root Cause
The [liquidationType2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L341) function attempts to convert ETH to WETH using `weth.deposit{value: amount}()`, but the `BorrowLiquidation` contract does not hold the necessary ETH, causing the deposit to fail.

### Internal pre-conditions
- The `BorrowLiquidation` contract must have received ETH from the user during the liquidation process.
- The `msg.value` must be equal to or greater than the amount required for the deposit.

### External pre-conditions
- The user must call the liquidation function with sufficient ETH sent as part of the transaction.

### Attack Path
1. A user’s position becomes liquidatable.
2. The admin calls the `borrowing:liquidate` function.
3. The `liquidate` function calls `BorrowLiquidation::liquidateBorrowPosition`, which internally calls `liquidationType2`.
4. The `weth.deposit` function is called without the contract holding the required ETH, causing the transaction to fail.

### Impact
The liquidation process is interrupted, preventing the user’s position from being liquidated and potentially leading to financial losses for the protocol.

### PoC
When a user deposits tokens, the funds are transferred to the treasury contract, meaning all deposited funds are held in the treasury contract. Now, consider a scenario where the user's position becomes liquidatable.

The admin calls the `borrowing:liquidate` function. Suppose the user is liquidated using **type 2 liquidation**. The `liquidate` function calls `BorrowLiquidation::liquidateBorrowPosition`, which internally calls `liquidationType2`. 

Here is the relevant code snippet:

```javascript
uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);

// Convert the ETH into WETH
// borrowing.sol calls -> borrowLiquidation -> weth.deposit 
// @audit This contract must hold ETH funds because `weth.deposit` is a payable function.
weth.deposit{value: amount}();

// Approve it, to mint sETH
bool approved = weth.approve(address(wrapper), amount);

if (!approved) revert BorrowLiq_ApproveFailed();

// Mint sETH
wrapper.mint(amount);
```

In this logic, the user's deposited ETH amount is converted by calling `weth.deposit`. This means the `BorrowLiquidation` contract (as `msg.sender`) must already hold the required ETH amount to successfully call `weth.deposit`. However, this contract does not hold ETH, and as a result, the `deposit` call fails. 

Here is the `weth.deposit` implementation for reference:

```javascript
function deposit() public payable {
    balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
}
```

Since the `BorrowLiquidation` contract does not hold the required ETH, the deposit will fail, and the liquidation process will be interrupted.
If you attempt to deposit an amount of Ether that you do not hold, the transaction will fail, and the weth.deposit function will not execute successfully.

### Mitigation
Retrieve the funds from the `treasury.sol` before calling the `deposit` function in `WETH`
