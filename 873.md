# `downsideProtected` can block withdrawals anytime funds are requested from other chains to cover downside

### Summary

When there are not enough funds in the current chain to cover the downside incurred, [the _deficit_ funds are requested form other chains](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L725-L741)

```solidity
File: borrowing.sol
686:         // if there is a downside, get it from cds
687:         {if (result.downsideProtected > 0) {
688:   @>        _getDownsideFromCDS(result.downsideProtected, msg.value - fee.nativeFee);
689:         } else {

```

### Root Cause

Taking a look at the `_getDownsideFromCDS()` function


```solidity
File: borrowing.sol
721:     function _getDownsideFromCDS(
722:         uint128 downsideProtected,
723:         uint256 feeForOFT
724:     ) internal {
725:         if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
726:             // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
727:             globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: feeForOFT}(
728:                 IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
729:    @>           IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),downsideProtected - cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()),
730:                 // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
731:                 IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
732:                 IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_WITHDRAW,
733:                 msg.sender 
734:             );
735:         } else {
736:             // updating downside protected from this chain in CDS
737:             cds.updateDownsideProtected(downsideProtected);
738:         }
739:         // Burn the borrow amount
740:         treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, address(this), downsideProtected);
741:         bool success = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), downsideProtected);

```
the amount requested form the other chains  is the shortfall of the current chain (`downsideProtected - cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()`) on L729.
Also, the entire `downsideProtected` is burned form the treasury of the current chain.

The problem is that in this scenario where a shortfall exists, the `downsideProtected` on the current chain is not updated and as such withdrawals can revert when there is a downside during withdrawal

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

DOS when withdrawing from the current chain as funds are no funds to transfer from the current chain

### PoC

- Alice calls `_withdraw()`
- `result.downsideProtected` = 2000
- the current chain has down side protection of 1800
- 200 is requested form other chains to cover the downside and sent to the treasury of the current chain
- the 200 and the previous 1800 of the current are burned and there is currently no `downsideProtected` to cover any downside on the current chain
- `cds.updateDownsideProtected()` is not called to reset the downside of the current chain
- Bod calls `_withdraw()`
- `result.downsideProtected` = 500
- because the previous down side protection value of 1800 was not updated for the current chain it proceed to attempt to burn 500 `usda` (L741) from the current chain but the transaction revert because there are not enough funds to transfer for the total deposited CDS amount in the current chain

### Mitigation

Modify the `_getDownsideFromCDS()` function as shown below

```diff
File: borrowing.sol
721:     function _getDownsideFromCDS(
722:         uint128 downsideProtected,
723:         uint256 feeForOFT
724:     ) internal {
725:         if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
726:             // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
727:             globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: feeForOFT}(
728:                 IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
729:                 IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),downsideProtected - cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()),
730:                 // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
731:                 IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
732:                 IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_WITHDRAW,
734:             );
+.                 cds.updateDownsideProtected(cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount();
735:         } else {
736:             // updating downside protected from this chain in CDS
737:             cds.updateDownsideProtected(downsideProtected);
738:         }
739:         // Burn the borrow amount
740:         treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, address(this), downsideProtected);
741:         bool success = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), downsideProtected);
742:         if (!success) revert Borrow_BurnFailed();
743:     }

```
