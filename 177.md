# We cannot make weth deposit before getting it from the treasury

### Summary
During liquidation with liquidation type  2 we try to make a wETH deposit before getting ETH out of the treasury which will result in a transaction revert and a DoS.

### Root Cause
The `borrowLiquidations` contract is likely to not have the funds to cover the deposit of wETH as the treasury is supposed to keep those assets. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L338-L341
```solidity
    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");

        // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000, "You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

        uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);

        // Convert the ETH into WETH
@>>     weth.deposit{value: amount}();
```
The logic will always revert, because of insufficient ETH balance.
