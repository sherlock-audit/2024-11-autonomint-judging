# Inaccurate Borrowed Amount Store Leading to Treasury Loss During Liquidation

### Summary


In the borrowing contract's when minted USDa tokens for users the `BorrowLib::deposit` function  incorrectly stores the full amount of USDa initially calculated for minting (`tokensToMint`) as the `borrowedAmount`, even though the actual amount minted and given to the user is reduced by the `optionFees`. This discrepancy leads to an overestimation of the user's debt, causing the treasury to burn more USDa tokens than necessary during liquidation, resulting in a loss for the treasury USDa amount.


### Root Cause


The [BorrowLib.deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L644) function incorrectly stores the  `tokensToMint` as the `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` without accounting for the deduction of `optionFees`. 

```solidity

     //...

     // Call the transfer function to mint USDa
@>>        uint256 tokensToMint = transferToken(
            interfaces.usda,
            libParams.LTV,
            address(interfaces.treasury),
            msg.sender,
            params.depositingAmount,
            libParams.ethPrice,
            optionFees
        );

        // Get global omnichain data
        IGlobalVariables.CollateralData memory collateralData = interfaces.globalVariables.getOmniChainCollateralData(params.assetName);

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in cds to split fees to cds users
        omniChainData.lastCumulativeRate = interfaces.cds.calculateCumulativeRate(uint128(optionFees));
        // Modify omnichain data
        omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees += optionFees;

        //Get the deposit details from treasury
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = interfaces.treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, depositResult.borrowerIndex);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        // Update the borrower details for this index
        depositDetail.depositedAmount = uint128(depositingAmount);
@>>        depositDetail.borrowedAmount = uint128(tokensToMint);
        depositDetail.optionFees = uint128(optionFees);
        depositDetail.APR = libParams.APR;
        depositDetail.exchangeRateAtDeposit = libParams.exchangeRate;

        //..
```


[tokensToMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L549) is calculated as the gross amount of USDa to be minted based on the collateral amount, collateralPrice and LTV.However, the actual amount received by the borrower is `tokensToMint - optionFees`. 

```solidity
    function transferToken(
        
        //...

        tokensToMint = tokensToLend(amount, collateralPrice, LTV);
@>        bool minted = usda.mint(borrower, (tokensToMint - optionFees));

        if (!minted) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_MintFailed();

        //Mint options fees to treasury
       bool treasuryMint = usda.mint(treasuryAddress, optionFees);

        if (!treasuryMint) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_MintFailed();
    }

```

Despite the deduction, the `depositDetail.borrowedAmount = uint128(tokensToMint)` is recorded as the gross `tokensToMint`, not the actual amount minted and transferred for the user.


When this position is liquidated, the `borrowLiquidation:liquidationType1` function uses the inflated and incorrect [depositDetail.borrowedAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L299) value to calculate how much USDa a user has in this position to liquidate and to burn from the treasury.


```solidity
        // Burn the borrow amount
        treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, address(this), depositDetail.borrowedAmount);
@>        bool success = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), depositDetail.borrowedAmount);
        if (!success) revert BorrowLiquidation_LiquidateBurnFailed();
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```


If `tokensToMint = 5000e6` and the `optionFees = 100e6`, the actual amount minted for the user by the protocol is `(tokensToMint - optionFees)`, which equals `4900e6` USDa. The `100e6` USDa from the `optionFees` is meant to be claimed by CDS users, not the borrowing user.  

However, the contract incorrectly stores `depositDetail.borrowedAmount = 5000e6`, which is the gross amount. When the position is liquidated, it burns `5000e6` USDa from the treasury instead of the correct `4900e6`, resulting in a loss of `100e6` USDa for the treasury.

### Attack Path


1. A user Deposit collateral and choice some options to get protection from volatile collateral prices, The protocol calculates and mint the amount of USDa for user and option fees for treasury that goes to dCDS users for protected that position.

2. The `transferToken` function mints USDa tokens for the user and a portion (`optionFees`) is deducted from user and transferred to treasury as fees.  

3. The contract records the full value of `tokensToMint = tokensToMint + optionsFees` for the `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` ignoring the actual amount received by the user and `optionsFees` that are not for the users.

4. If the user's position is liquidated, the `borrowLiquidation:liquidationType1` function uses the incorrect `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` to burn from treasury it also included the `optionsFess` this causes the treasury to burn more USDa than the user actually received, effectively transferring the discrepancy (`optionFees`) as a loss to the treasury.



### Impact

### Mitigation


The solution is to store the correct borrowed amount in the `depositDetail` struct.  Modify the `deposit` function in `BorrowLib` as follows:

```solidity
// ... other code ...

// Call the transfer function to mint USDa
uint256 tokensToMint = transferToken(
    interfaces.usda,
    libParams.LTV,
    address(interfaces.treasury),
    msg.sender,
    params.depositingAmount,
    libParams.ethPrice,
    optionFees
);

// Correct the borrowed amount calculation
uint256 borrowedAmount = tokensToMint - optionFees; 

// ... other code ...

// Update the borrower details for this index
depositDetail.borrowedAmount = uint128(borrowedAmount);

// ... rest of the code ...
```

By subtracting `optionFees` from `tokensToMint` before storing the value in `depositDetail.borrowedAmount`, the contract will accurately reflect the user's debt, preventing the treasury loss during liquidation.  This change ensures that the correct amount of USDa is burned during liquidation.
