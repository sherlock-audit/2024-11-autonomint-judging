# Incorrect Use of `lastEthPrice` in `calculateRatio` During CDS Withdrawal

### Summary

The `calculateRatio` function relies on the `lastEthPrice` variable to calculate the ratio between the vault value and CDS pool value, factoring in profit/loss based on ETH price changes. However, in the flow leading to this function call, the `lastEthPrice` is prematurely updated to the current ETH price within the `_calculateCumulativeValue` function. This causes `calculateRatio` to treat `lastEthPrice` and `currentEthPrice` as equal, resulting in zero profit/loss calculations.



### Root Cause

The `lastEthPrice` is updated in the `_calculateCumulativeValue` function **before** the `calculateRatio` function uses it. This overwrites the historical ETH price (`lastEthPrice`) with the current ETH price, eliminating the ability to calculate price-based profit or loss in `calculateRatio`.

### Attack Path

1. During CDS withdrawal, _calculateCumulativeValue is invoked, 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L310-L314
which updates lastEthPrice to the current ETH price.

2. The calculateRatio function is then called, using the updated lastEthPrice, which is now identical to currentEthPrice.

3. As a result, the profit/loss (netPLCdsPool) is calculated as zero, rendering the CDS pool's value unaltered.

4. The resulting ratio is inaccurate

### Impact

erroneus logic in this two places due to wrong ratio calculations
1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L402

2. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L671

3, other places where omniChainData.cdsPoolValue is updated such as

### PoC

### Mitigation

Adjust the logic
