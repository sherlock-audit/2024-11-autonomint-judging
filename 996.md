# Missing Liquidation Gains Update Leads to Zero Yield Redemptions in BorrowLib::redeemYields

### Summary

A critical oversight has been identified in the `BorrowLiquidation` contract where the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable in the Treasury contract fails to update during liquidation events. This omission has severe implications for the yield distribution mechanism implemented in the [redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1002) function of the BorrowLib library.

### Root Cause

The core issue stems from an implementation gap where the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` tracker remains static during liquidation events. This stagnant state cascades into the `Borrowlib::redeemYields` function's calculations, resulting in users being unable to claim their rightful yield distributions.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The ramifications of this vulnerability are significant:

1. Yield Distribution Failure: Users attempting to claim their earned yields receive zero tokens due to incorrect calculations
2. Economic Impact: Legitimate yield earnings become inaccessible to stakeholders
3. Protocol Trust: The malfunction in yield distribution could severely impact user confidence
4. System Integrity: The yield mechanism's reliability is compromised

### PoC

The following code segment demonstrates how the zero-value propagates through the calculations:

```javascript
uint128 usdaToAbondRatioLiq = uint128((treasury.usdaGainedFromLiquidation() * RATE_PRECISION) / abond.totalSupply());
uint256 usdaToTransfer = (usdaToAbondRatioLiq * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION;
```

Due to `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` remaining at zero, all subsequent calculations result in zero transfers, effectively nullifying the yield distribution mechanism.

### Mitigation

To resolve this vulnerability, implement proper updating mechanisms for the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable within the liquidation functions.
