# Liquidation type 2 can cause loss of funds in conversion due to delay on submission and execution of delayed order

### Summary

Liquidation type 2 is using Synthetix for liquidating the ether collateral and this process involves [submitting offchain delayed order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L362).

```Solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
361:         // Submit an offchain delayed order in synthetix for short position with 1X leverage, like parking the order before execution
362:         synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
363:             -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
364:             currentEthPrice * 1e16
365:         );
```

However, this submitOffchainDelayedOrder can be reverted for various reasons like [market volatility](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/PerpsV2MarketBase.sol#L521) and [too large order size](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/PerpsV2MarketBase.sol#L586-L587). 

One more thing is if there is also delay in [execution](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L381-L385) of submitted Delayed order due to various reasons, this can cause also delay to subsequent liquidations. This is possible because of this checking in [submit delayed order](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/PerpsV2MarketDelayedIntent.sol#L165). In other words, the delayed order can be processed only one at a time. If there is pending order, the subsequent orders won't be processed.  

```Solidity
 File: PerpsV2MarketDelayedIntent.sol
164:         // check that a previous order doesn't exist
165:         require(marketState.delayedOrders(messageSender).sizeDelta == 0, "previous order exists");
```

A one second or one block delay in executing liquidation can cause loss of funds due to conversion of sETH to sUSD. Delay on conversion is equal to loss on conversion specially if the exchange rate is going down.

```Solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
349:         // Exchange sETH with sUSD, it sets the sUSD balance of borrowing contract after exchange
350:         synthetix.exchange(
351:             0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
352:             amount,
353:             0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
354:         );
```

### Root Cause

There are two stages that can cause delay of processing liquidation type 2:
1. Revert on submission of delayed order due to market volatility or large size order.
2. Delay on Execution of submitted delayed order due to various reasons like network issue or system issue.

 A delay in liquidation can cause loss of funds due to delay in conversion of ether collateral into stable asset sUSD.
 If there is potential delay on submission and executing delayed order, this process should be separated from the liquidation itself to avoid loss of funds in conversion to sUSD.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Revert on _posttradedetails due to various factors such as market volatility or large size order.
2. Delay on Execution of submitted delayed order due to various reasons like network issue or system issue.

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

This can be the scenario

1. Liquidation Type 2 has been executed to liquidate a loan with collateral backed worth 10 Ether equivalent to 30,000 sUSD in conversion.
2. This liquidation has been delayed due to revert on Synthetix _posttradedetails function as a result of market volatility or some other reason.
3. Liquidation has been executed again and this time successful but the conversion is smaller, only 27,000 sUSD. This can be considered as 3000 sUSD loss of funds in conversion due to delay in liquidation.
4. Since there is a delay in liquidation for this particular loan, subsequent loans are  pending to be liquidated. Remember that delayed order can only be processed one at a time.
5. Subsequent loans suffered from loss on conversion due to delay on time of liquidation.

### Impact

A delay in execution of submitted delayed order can cause delay in liquidation in which it can cause loss of funds.

### PoC

See attack path

### Mitigation

Separate the submission of delayed order from the liquidation process itself. The liquidation type 2 should prioritize the conversion of sETH to sUSD without any potential delay so it can save the value of sETH.
