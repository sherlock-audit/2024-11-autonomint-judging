# Reversion Risk Due to Insufficient Check in `totalCdsDepositedAmount` Update

### Summary

The current implementation of the update to `totalCdsDepositedAmount` does not adequately check if the value of `params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` is greater than the available `totalCdsDepositedAmount` before performing the subtraction. If `params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` increases unexpectedly, it can lead to a situation where the subtraction causes the `totalCdsDepositedAmount` to become negative, triggering a revert. This can disrupt the normal operation of the CDS withdraw function for CDS depositors who do not opt for liquidation, potentially causing the transaction to fail.

### Root Cause

1. The value of `params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` is updated during the CDS `withdraw` process using a value calculated in `cdsAmountToReturn`.

If this value increases unexpectedly, it can cause the updated depositedAmount to exceed the available totalCdsDepositedAmount, which leads to revertion here

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. During the CDS withdrawal process, the `params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` is recalculated, potentially increasing due to changes in currentValue.

2. If the recalculated value is greater than the current `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, the subtraction will lead to a negative value for `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.

3. This triggers a revert, preventing the withdrawal from completing successfully.

### Impact

Transaction Failure: The CDS `withdraw` function will fail if the `totalCdsDepositedAmount` becomes negative due to underflow error

### Mitigation

Pre-Subtraction Check:
Before performing the subtraction of `params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` from `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, ensure that the deposited amount is not greater than the available total. As done here
