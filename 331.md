# Price Overflow Due to Insufficient uint64 Type for ETH Price in `Options.sol::calculateStrikePriceGains()`

## Summary
The Options contract uses uint64 for storing ETH price values, which may be insufficient to store large price values when considering decimal precision, potentially leading to price overflows and incorrect option calculations.

## Vulnerability Details:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Options.sol#L80
```solidity
function calculateStrikePriceGains(
    uint128 depositedAmount,
    uint128 strikePrice,
    uint64 ethPrice // @audit overflow of Price since it is being used as uint64
) external view onlyBorrowingContract returns (uint128) {
```

The maximum value of uint64 is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (2^64 - 1).
Consider ETH price with 18 decimals:
ETH at $2,000:
$2,000 * 10^18 = 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
This exceeds uint64 max value

## Impact
Price overflow could lead to:
- Incorrect option pricing
- Wrong strike price calculations
- Invalid premium computations
- Failed option executions

## Recommendation
Use uint128 for ETH price storage
Consider using a more precise data type
Add overflow checks before scaling
