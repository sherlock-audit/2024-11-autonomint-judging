# ChainLink Oracle not checking if Optimism L2 sequencer is down


## Summary

When using Chainlink with L2 chains like Optimism, smart contracts must check whether the L2 Sequencer is down to avoid stale pricing data that appears fresh.

[Relevant Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83)

## Vulnerability Details

If the Optimism Sequencer is down, messages cannot be transmitted from L1 to L2 and no L2 transactions are executed. As a result, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. You can review Chainlink docs on L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds for more details on this. Here is the [Reference](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#handling-outages-on-optimism-base-metis-and-scroll).

## Impact

Using stale priceFeed could cause the following problems:

From the attacker's perspective, they could exploit this to borrow stablecoins with less collateral value cost.

From the perspective of protocol design, using outdated oracle price data introduces a range of issues. Since the protocol’s key metric calculations—such as `calculateRatio`, `calculateDownsideProtected`, and `calculateEthPriceRatio`—require up-to-date and low-latency ethPrice records, stale price data leads to inaccuracies in these calculations. This can cause the protocol to deviate from its intended operation.

Moreover, if the stale oracle data result in the actual price (actualPrice) falling below the reported price (feedPrice), it could break the invariant:

> New Borrows cannot mint new stablecoin if cds/borrow ratio is below 0.2 and cds users cannot withdraw. This might have a user experience issue.

Such issues could negatively impact user experience and the protocol’s reliability.

## Recommended mitigation

It is recommended to follow the [code example](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code) of Chainlink.
