# An attacker will freeze the borrowing protocol.


### Summary

The missing update of `lastEventTime` in [`borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L530-L542) will cause freezing of the protocol as an attacker will increase `borrowing.lastCumulativeRate` much bigger without limit.

### Root Cause

- In `borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()` function, `lastEventTime` is not updated.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `block.timestamp` is a little bigger than `lastEventTime`.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker continues to call `borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()`.
2. `lastCumulativeRate` continues to increase, leading to an increase in the borrower's debt.
3. The protocol can be frozen.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete freeze, preventing any borrowing operations.

### Mitigation

`borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()` function has to be modified as follows.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
++      lastEventTime = block.timestamp;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
