# Misuse of EIP-712 Domain Separator and Chain ID Handling

### Summary

The reliance on a static EIP-712 domain separator without handling potential chain ID changes will cause signature verification issues or replay attacks for the protocol, as domain separators may become invalid or be reused across chains.

### Root Cause

In `Borrowing.sol` and `CDS.sol`, the domain separator relies on the chain ID, which may change due to forks or network upgrades, and there's no dynamic update or handling for such changes.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L113

```solidity
  bytes32 public constant PERMIT_TYPEHASH =
      keccak256(
          "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
      );
  // ...

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The domain separator is calculated using a potentially outdated or static chain ID.

### External pre-conditions

The blockchain undergoes a fork or upgrade that changes the chain ID.

### Attack Path

1. If the chain ID changes, the domain separator becomes invalid.
2. This may result in signatures being rejected or, if not correctly handled, allow attackers to reuse signatures on another chain.

### Impact

Users may experience transaction failures due to invalid signatures, or attackers may replay signatures on different chains, leading to unauthorized actions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `block.chainid` to dynamically obtain the current chain ID when generating the domain separator. This ensures that the domain separator remains valid if the chain ID changes.
