# borrowing::_withdraw - `lastEventTime` is updated before calling `calculateCumulativeRate`

### Summary

`calculateCumulativeRate` is supposed to update `lastCumulativeRate` based on several factors like number of borrowers, rater per sec, last event time and the last cumulative rate. It's very important that the function is called in the correct places otherwise issues can occur.

In `_withdraw`, `lastEventTime` is updated before calling `calculateCumulativeRate` so no update will happen for the time between `lastEventTime` and `block.timestamp`, since we update `lastEventTime` before calculating the new rate, so `lastCumulativeRate` won't change.

```jsx
function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        ...
        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
 ->   lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
        calculateCumulativeRate();

        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositDetail.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`lastEventTime` is updated before calling `calculateCumulativeRate` so no update will happen for the time between `lastEventTime` and `block.timestamp`, since we update `lastEventTime` before calculating the new rate, so `lastCumulativeRate` won't change.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `lastEventTime` after calling `calculateCumulativeRate`
