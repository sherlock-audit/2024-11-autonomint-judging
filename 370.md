# Malicious Actor Can Cause Denial of Service and Transfer Failures for Users.

### Summary

Due to the lack of Implementation of the [isContract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L150-L152) function in the `CDS.sol:withdraw` function  a malicious actor with a fallback function can perform gas intensive operation effectively consuming all gas sent by the contract, Additionally, if the target contract lacks a fallback or receive function to accept Ether, any Ether transfer to it would fail, causing the withdrawal process to revert. This issue arise in the withdraw logic below
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L408-L412


### Root Cause

1. In the withdraw function in `CDS.sol` fails to implement the `isContract` function to check if the recipient  address is a contract address allowing malicious contracts to execute gas griefing attacks via a fallback function. 
2. It also fails to validate whether the recipient has a receive or fallback function to handle Ether transfers. If absent, Ether transfer attempts will revert, potentially disrupting withdrawals.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor deploys a contract with a fallback function that performs gas intensive operations
2. The actor invokes the withdraw function, specifying their malicious contract as the recipient and sends excess gas
3. During the execution of the withdrawal, the contract's fallback function is triggered when the call operation attempts to send Ether back to the user after deducting fees (when both optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain and withdrawResult.ethAmount are zero).
4.The gas-intensive operations in the fallback function consume the available gas, causing the transaction to fail.

### Impact

-  A malicious actor can prevent valid users from successfully withdrawing their funds.
- Users or contracts without proper Ether-receiving functions cannot access their funds, leading to frustration and potential loss of funds if misconfigured addresses are used.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Implement the function `isContract` to allow only EOAs to withdraw.
- Set a gasLimit for low-level call
