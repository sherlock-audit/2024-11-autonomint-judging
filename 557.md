# cds owners may fail to withdraw

### Summary

In withdrawUser(), we try to wrap RsETH too early. This will cause that cds owner's withdraw will be reverted.

### Root Cause

In withdrawUser function, if the collateral amount is not balanced, we may need to [transfer some collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L779-L795) from the other chain.

WrsETH is a little different. Because WrsETH is not one OFT token. So when we transfer WrsETH from the other chain, we will unwarp WrsETH to rsETH and transfer to this chain. After that, we should wrap the received rsETH to WrsETH again.

The problem is that the LayerZero message is async. When we send one message to ask for some rsETH from the other chain, we have no rsETH until now. The rsETH tokens may be received after several blocks. This will cause that function wrapRsETH() will be reverted because we do not have enough rsETH to be wrapped.

                    interfaces.globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{
                        value: msg.value - params.fee
                    }(
                        IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(
                            getLzFunctionToDo(params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain, collateralToGetFromOtherChain)
                        ),
                        IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(interfaces.treasury), params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain),
                        IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(
                            address(interfaces.treasury),
                            ethAmountFromOtherChain,
                            weETHAmountFromOtherChain,
                            rsETHAmountFromOtherChain
                        ),
                        IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.CDS_WITHDRAW,
                        msg.sender
                    );
                    if (rsETHAmountFromOtherChain > 0) {
                        interfaces.treasury.wrapRsETH(rsETHAmountFromOtherChain);
                    }
```

When we receive the rsETH, admin can manually trigger the function to wrap rsETH to WrsETH.
