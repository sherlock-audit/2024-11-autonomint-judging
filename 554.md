# Denial of Service in `CDSLib::withdrawUser` function

### Summary

Whenever `liquidationType1` occurs, `OmniChainData.noOfLiquidations` is [increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L199).

The `noOfLiquidations` in global data is increasing monotonically and there is no limit obviously, because liquidations will keep occurring throughout the life of the protocol as its an integral functionality of the protocol.

So, if there is a user, who kept his funds deposited in CDS for a along period of time during which a large number of liquidations occurred globally, then user will not be able to withdraw and his funds will stuck in the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `CDSLib::withdrawUser` function, all global liquidations are [looped](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L639) over, starting from the `liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1` to the `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations`.

It will only do the computations [while](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L642) `liquidationAmount > 0` however, the issue here is that even if `liquidationAmount` becomes `0`, it will keep looping till the end because there is no short-circuit logic implemented within the [loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L639C1-L663C18).

The prerequisites are mentioned in the `Internal pre-conditions` section.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has deposited for a reasonably long period of time
2. User has opted for liquidation
3. Admin has opted for liquidationType1
4. Large number of global liquidations occurred during the period

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If certain conditions are met, CDS depositor will not be able to withdraw and funds will stuck in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add below condition before [this line of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L642)

```diff
++ if (liquidationAmount == 0) break;
```
