# Missing Validation Between Strike Price and Strike Percent

### Summary

The system's option fee calculation function lacks proper validation between the strikePrice and strikePercent parameters. Users can manipulate these inputs by setting a high strikePercent to reduce the option fee while selecting a low strikePrice to retain most of the collateral's upside potential

### Root Cause

The function calculateOptionPrice calculates the fee using strikePercent, while the deposited collateral's valuation is determined by strikePrice. There is no validation ensuring consistency between these two parameters.

```solidity
  function deposit(
        IBorrowing.BorrowLibDeposit_Params memory libParams,
        IBorrowing.BorrowDepositParams memory params,
        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        mapping(IBorrowing.AssetName => address assetAddress) storage assetAddress
    ) public returns (uint256) {

//
        // Call calculateOptionPrice in options contract to get options fees
        uint256 optionFees = interfaces.options.calculateOptionPrice(
            libParams.ethPrice,
            params.volatility,
            params.depositingAmount,
            params.strikePercent
        );
//

        // Update the borrower details for this index
        depositDetail.normalizedAmount = uint128(normalizedAmount);
        depositDetail.strikePrice = params.strikePrice * uint128(params.depositingAmount);

}
```

### Attack Path

1. A user selects a high strikePercent, reducing the calculated option fee.
2. Simultaneously, the user chooses a low strikePrice, securing a higher collateral value.
3. In a market increase, the user's upside is protected using the low strikePrice.
4. The user benefits from minimized fees due to the unrelated strikePercent value.

### Impact

The protocol could lose significant revenue from reduced fees.

### Mitigation

Implement a validation mechanism to ensure consistency between strikePrice and strikePercent.
