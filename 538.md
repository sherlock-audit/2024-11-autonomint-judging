# Non compliance with EIP712 - Incorrect encoding of strings in signature verification



### Summary

Protocol uses EIP712 to verify signatures, and as such expects to be compliance the standard. But it isn't. In multiple places, the standard is not adhered to.
### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.sol, `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is defined as below with string name and string version.

```solidity
    bytes32 public constant PERMIT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
        );
```
But when the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L112-L114), the hashing directly uses the [string name and version](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L45-L46) without any encoding.

```solidity
        // Get the DOMAIN SEPARATOR
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(abi.encode(BorrowLib.PERMIT_TYPEHASH, BorrowLib.name, BorrowLib.version, chainId, address(this)));

```
This goes against the [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-encodedata) which insists that dynamic types should be encoded as a keccak256 hash of their contents.

> The dynamic values bytes and string are encoded as a keccak256 hash of their contents.

Also, in CDS.sol, the `digest` is [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L899-L918) as below, where the `bytes odosExecutionData` parameter is used as is, even though its a dynamic type and as established above, should be encoded as a keccak256 hash of its contents.

```solidity
            digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        keccak256("OdosPermit(bytes odosExecutionData)"),
                        odosExecutionData
                    )
                )
            );
        }
```

### Attack Path
_No response_


### Impact

Lack of compliance with EIP712, issues with signature verification.

### PoC
_No response_
 
### Mitigation
Hash the string and bytes parameter, before passing it into the digest.
