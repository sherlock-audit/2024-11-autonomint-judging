# Lack of Validation for msg.value Sufficiency

### Summary

In `CDS.sol:withdraw` and `borrowing.sol:_withdraw` there is no check if the `msg.value` is sufficient to cover for `fee.nativeFee` This omission can lead to Potentially incorrect refund behavior, as users may unintentionally provide insufficient Ether.

### Root Cause

In both `CDS.sol:withdraw` and `borrowing.sol:_withdraw` there is no check if `msg.value` is sufficient before transfering the gas fee back. 
### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The User provides `msg.value` less than the `fee.nativeFee`.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
Transactions with insufficient `msg.value` will revert unexpectedly.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider adding the below check.
``` solidity
   uint256 requiredGas = msg.value - fee.nativeFee;
        if (requiredGas > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: requiredGas}("");
            if (!sent) revert CDS_ETH_TransferFailed();
        }```
