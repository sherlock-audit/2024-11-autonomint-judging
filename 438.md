# Non-functional wrapper in BorrowLiquidation

### Summary

The synthetix's wrapper in OP Chain is empty. It cannot help us to wrap WETH to sETH.

### Root Cause

In [borrowLiquidation.sol:348](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L348), we will wrap WETH to sETH via synthetix's wrapper.

The problem is that I find out that the synthetix's wrapper in OP Chain is different with Ethereum's wrapper.  The synthetix's wrapper in OP Chainis one empty wrapper chain(https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc3Ee42caBD773A608fa9Ec951982c94BD6F33d59) after checking from (https://developer.synthetix.io/addresses/).

So in OP chain, the empty wrapper does not support mint() interface. So this liquidation will be reverted.
```solidity
    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {
        ...
        wrapper.mint(amount);
}
```

### Impact

The liquidation type 2 cannot work in OP chain.
Considering that liquidation type 1 cannot work in some cases, e.g. there is not enough cds owners who opt in the liquidation, it's important to make sure that the liquidation type 2 can always work well.

### Mitigation

synthetix support to exchange WETH to sUSD directly.
