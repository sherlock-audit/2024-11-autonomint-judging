# `strikePrice` is not validated on `borrowing::depositTokens()` and can be sent as the same price as the deposit to exploit

### Summary

`strikePrice` should be one of the percentages, 5 and so on, but it is actually not validated and can be sent arbitrarily. An amount below the deposit price will make it revert as the calculations in `BorrowLib::calculateCollateralToReturn()` underflow, but specifying exactly the deposit price times the deposited amount allows borrowers to get as much collateral as possible back, without giving the component below the strike price to cds depositors.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing::depositTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L226), strikePrice is not validated.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower borrows with strike price the same as the deposit price.
2. When calculating the collateral amount to return, `collateralToReturn` will be the full collateral.

### Impact

Borrower always gets the full collateral back and has downside protection.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Validate the strike price.
