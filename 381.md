# The owner cannot withdraw the interest from liquidation.

### Summary

Wrong implementation of withdrawing interest from treasury will cause revert for the owner to withdraw interest from liquidation.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L622

### Root Cause

- In `Treasury.sol#withdrawInterest()`, there can be underflow for withdrawing the interest from liquidation.
```solidity
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
621@>   require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
622@>   totalInterest -= amount;
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```
From L622, we can see withdrawable amount is `(totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation)`. But if `amount > totalInterest`, `L622` is reverted.

### Mitigation

`Treasury.sol#withdrawInterest()` function has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
        require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
--      totalInterest -= amount;
++      if(amount <= totalInterest){
++          totalInterest -= amount;
++      }else{
++          totalInterestFromLiquidation -= amount - totalInterest;
++          totalInterest = 0;
++      }
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```
