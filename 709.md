# Missing Import of OwnableUpgradeable Causes Deployment and Initialization Failure.

### Summary

The missing import of `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` in `GlobalVariables.sol` prevents the proper initialization of ownership through the `__Ownable_init()` function. This leads to a denial of service (DoS) since the `initialize` function cannot execute successfully, blocking the deployment and operation of the contract. Furthermore, critical access control mechanisms, such as the `onlyOwner` modifier used in functions like `_authorizeUpgrade`, would fail.

### Root Cause

In `GlobalVariables.sol` there is a missing import of `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` from openzeppelin.

### Impact

The missing import of `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` in `GlobalVariables.sol` prevents the proper initialization of ownership through the `__Ownable_init()` function, Without the owner being set, all `onlyOwner`-restricted functions, such as `_authorizeUpgrade`, remain unprotected. This creates a significant security risk, as any address could potentially execute privileged functions, including upgrading the contract to malicious implementations. Additionally, the contract cannot be deployed or initialized correctly, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS).


### PoC

### Mitigation

- Import the `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` from openzeppelin.
- Enable the contract to inherit the `OwnableUpgradeable.sol`.
