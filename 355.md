# Admin can set the new admin to be an EOA breaking core logic

### Summary

Insufficient check in `borrowing.sol::isContract()` allows the admin to set a contract as the new admin which is contrary to what is stated in the README . This will also lock all admin controlled functions.

The same issue is present in all admin controlled contracts.

### Root Cause

In `borrowing.sol::211` there is a check if the new admin is a contracts using the `isContract` function which can be bypassed using `create2`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The function must have the required approvals from owners
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L213-L214

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Create a contract using `create2`
2. Take the address where it was deployed and destroy the contract
3. Use the address when calling the `setAdmin` function allowing the call to pass because on the specified address there is no longer a contract
4. Using `create2` deploy the contract at the same address, making the contract the admin of the protocol

### Impact

The protocol admin role is locked and the README clearly states that an EOA cannot be an admin of the protocol which can clearly be bypassed.

"setTreasury() can be called only by Admin and the input can't be any EOA accounts and zero address."
