# Incorrect calculation of usdtAmount causes losses in CDS::redeemUSDT

### Summary

Autonomint acts like a DEX, allowing users to swap USDa for USDT by calling `CDS::redeemUSDT()`.

`CDS::redeemUSDT` is an important peg stability mechanism for USDa. If the price of USDa drops below $1, there's an arbitrage opportunity allowing users to profit by redeeming USDa for USDT. USDa is burned during each redeem, which decreases supply of USDa and drives the price back up to peg.

When a user calls `CDS::redeemUSDT()`, the protocol calculates the amount of USDT to send to the user based on the amount of USDa being redeemed:

The calculation incorrect calculates the `usdtAmount` and causes losses for the protocol or user depending on the price ratio of USDa to USDT.

- If the price of USDa is less than USDT ($0.99 usda < $1.01 usdt), then the protocol won't send the user enough USDT
- If price of USDa is greater than USDT ($1.01 usda > $0.99 usdt), then the protocol will send the user too much USDT

### Root Cause

Incorrect calculation of `uint128 usdtAmount`. The `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` should be swapped. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User call `CDS::redeemUSDT()`

### External pre-conditions

1. The price of USDT to USDa isn't 1:1

### Attack Path

1. Say the price of USDa is $0.99 and the price of USDT is $1.01 creating an arbitrage opportunity. 
2. A user takes advantage of this by calling `CDS::redeemYields`, passing in 10000e6 USDa to redeem
3. The USDT amount they'll receive is calculated by `((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice) = ($0.99 * $10000) / $1.01) = $9801. The user actually loses the amount they think they'll gain.

### Impact

Loss of funds for protocol or user depending on which way the peg destabalized

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
- uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
+ uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdtPrice * usdaAmount) / usdaPrice);
```
