# no method to withdraw interest gained from liquidations. They're forever stuck in the contract.

### Summary

`totalInterestFromLiquidation` has no method by which it can be withdrawn. Hence they're stuck in the treasury contract
forever.


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L616-L625

### Root Cause

In `Treasury.withdrawInterest()`, the amount the owner wants to withdraw is checked to be within `totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation` but when the interests are being withdrawn there's only logic for withdrawing 
`totalInterest` hence they're only deducted from `totalInterest`.
```solidity
   function withdrawInterest(//@audit-issue no method to withdraw interest gained from liquidations. They're forever stuck in the contract.
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
        require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");//@audit
        totalInterest -= amount;//@audit
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

```

Now checking the codebase there's no other method for withdrawing  interest gained from liquidations(`totalInterestFromLiquidation`) so they're stuck in the treasury contract forever.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

High severity. 

interest gained from liquidations(`totalInterestFromLiquidation`) are stuck in the contract forever hence they're lost forever.

The protocol will lose more than 1% and more than $10 of the total interest gained from liquidations. (they will lose it all)

Meets the Direct loss of funds without (extensive) limitations of external conditions. The loss of the affected party is  significant.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify withdrawInterest()
```solidity
   function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
+       uint256 interestFromLiquidationAmount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
        require(amount + interestFromLiquidationAmount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
        totalInterest -= amount;
+       totalInterestFromLiquidation -= interestFromLiquidationAmount
        

    }
 ```
    

or you create a different function all together that owner can use to withdraw `totalInterestFromLiquidation`
