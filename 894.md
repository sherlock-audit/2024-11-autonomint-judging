# Signature Replay Vulnerability in CDS Protocol's Verification System

## Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the CDS contract's signature verification mechanism where the `_verify` function lacks proper nonce tracking and replay protection. While nonces are included in the signed message for CDS_WITHDRAW operations, the contract does not maintain any state to track used nonces, allowing the same signature to be replayed multiple times.

In the current implementation, when verifying signatures for withdrawals, the contract accepts a nonce parameter but never records or validates it against any stored state. This means that once a valid admin signature is captured, it remains valid for repeated use since the contract has no mechanism to detect or prevent reuse of previously processed signatures.

The security implications are severe, particularly in a cross-chain context. Since signature verification occurs independently on each chain with no shared state of used nonces, an attacker could replay captured signatures across different chains to execute unauthorized withdrawals multiple times.

## Scenario

An attacker capturing a valid admin signature can repeatedly execute withdrawals since the contract provides no mechanism to invalidate used signatures. The attack becomes particularly potent in cross-chain scenarios where the same signature can be replayed across different blockchain networks.

## Recommended mitigation steps
```solidity
contract CDS {
    mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;
    
    function _verify(
        FunctionName functionName,
        uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes memory odosExecutionData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) private returns (bool) {
        if (nonce != nonces[adminTwo]) revert InvalidNonce();
        
        bytes32 digest;
        if (functionName == FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW) {
            digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        keccak256(
                            "Permit(uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,uint256 nonce)"
                        ),
                        excessProfitCumulativeValue,
                        nonce
                    )
                )
            );
        }
        
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
        bytes32 hashedSigner = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(signer));
        
        if (hashedSigner == hashedAdminTwo) {
            nonces[adminTwo]++;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The fix introduces proper nonce tracking through contract state, ensuring each signature can only be used once. By maintaining and incrementing nonces after successful verification, the contract prevents signature replay attacks while preserving the existing authorization flow. The _verify function becomes non-view to handle these state changes appropriately.
