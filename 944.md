# Missing Heartbeat Interval and Zero-Price Validation in MasterPriceOracle

## Summary  
The protocol integrates [Chainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L80C13-L91C61)) Oracles to retrieve price data for underlying assets and ETH on the Optimism network. However, the current implementation lacks crucial safety measures, specifically the validation of the heartbeat interval and price checks ensuring values are greater than zero. These gaps may allow the system to accept stale or zero prices from the oracle, which could lead to incorrect price calculations, potentially causing financial losses for the protocol and its users. 

The protocol should implement checks against the heartbeat interval, as specified in the [Chainlink Price Feeds documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=ethereum&page=1) to prevent the use of outdated price data. Additionally, it should ensure that prices returned by the oracle are greater than zero.

## Root Cause  
The failure to incorporate heartbeat interval checks and price validation (to ensure prices are greater than zero) in the Chainlink Oracle integration allows outdated or erroneous prices to be utilized, risking faulty financial calculations and protocol instability.

## Internal Preconditions  
- The protocol retrieves prices via Chainlink Oracles without validating their freshness or validity.
  
## External Preconditions  
- Chainlink Oracle feeds may experience delays or network issues, resulting in stale or zero prices being returned.

## Attack Path  
1. The Chainlink Oracle may return a stale price due to delays in updating the feed or network failures. Without validation, the protocol may accept this outdated price.  
2. The protocol could mistakenly accept a price of `0` from the Oracle, leading to incorrect financial transactions or calculations that could be exploited or result in unintentional losses.

## Impact  
- **Financial Loss**: Incorrect operations performed due to stale or zero prices could lead to improper fund management or incorrect payouts.  
- **Exploitation Risk**: Attackers could exploit the lack of proper validation to manipulate the protocol by introducing stale or zero prices.  
- **Trust Degradation**: The protocolâ€™s credibility may suffer as users lose confidence in its ability to provide accurate price data, especially if financial losses occur due to these issues.

## Mitigation  
To mitigate these issues, the protocol should validate the heartbeat interval against the last updated timestamp of the oracle data and ensure that the prices returned are greater than zero. This will prevent the usage of stale or incorrect price feeds from the oracle.
