# Lack of Stale Price and decimals Validation in _price Function

### Summary

The [`_price`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L53)  function fetches prices from oracles to calculate the USD value of ETH and exchange rates for collaterals. However, the function does not validate whether the fetched prices are stale. This omission creates a risk of using outdated or invalid prices for critical protocol operations, such as collateral valuation and liquidation, which could lead to inaccurate calculations and potential financial losses. the other risk for the decimals is to have wrong amounts which can break the procol.



### Root Cause

1. The _price function retrieves price data using:
- oracle.priceOf(underlying) and oracle.priceOfETH() for Redstone oracles.
- oracle.latestRoundData() for Chainlink oracles.
2. Neither method includes a check to validate the freshness of the fetched prices.
3. Stale prices can occur due to:
- Oracle service disruptions.
- Network congestion or downtime.
- Issues with the data feed itself.

### Impact

Stale prices lead to incorrect collateral valuations, affecting borrowing limits and liquidation thresholds.

### Mitigation

add a timestamp check to validate oracle fresh data
