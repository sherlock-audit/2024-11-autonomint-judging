# `odosAssembleData` is user-specified

### Summary

When withdrawing from borrowing.sol if there is any remaining collateral it must be swapped for USDT through the Odos Router. This happens in order for the protocol to receive upside if the price of the collateral has grown. The issue is that the calldata, used for the swap, is provided by the withdrawer, thus the withdrawer can steal all of the upside that should be received by the protocol.

### Root Cause

In borrowing.withDraw the caller provides the `odosAssembledData` needed to swap the upside collateral through Odos:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L284

This is extremely problematic as the upside collateral must be received by the protocol, and by allowing the caller to provide the Odos calldata, they are enabled to steal the upside or provide empty data so that the swap does not get executed.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user withdraws their deposited collateral.
2. There has been an upside of 0.1 ETH that must be claimed by the protocol.
3. However, the user sets their address as the address to receive the swapped USDT from Odos, thus stealing the upside.

### Impact

Users can steal funds that should be claimed by the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The calldata used for the Odos swap should not be provided by the user, but instead set by an admin.
