# Borrrower with 8 001 to 9 999 health with lose funds while withraw due to miscalculation in calculateCollateralToReturn() if collateral is erc20

### Summary

in BorrowLib() calculateCollateralToReturn() we expect to calculate collateral to return to user depends on eth price and his gains, meanwhile when user's health between 8001 and 9999 range issue arise
in calculateCollateralToReturn() we calculate depositedAmountValue(depends on difference between eth price in moment of deposit and current price)  and collateralToReturn depends on our gains from options
```solidity
        uint128 collateralToReturn;
        //Calculate current depositedAmount value
        uint128 depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice;
        uint128 collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        // If the health is greater than 1
        if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000) {
            // If the ethPrice is higher than deposit ethPrice,call withdrawOption in options contract
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
            // increment the difference between collatearla to  return and deposited amount in collateralRemainingInWithdraw
            collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralToReturn;
 ```
 collateralRemainingInWithdraw should be the difference between (current eth price x eth amount) and our initial eth amount
 essentially it will amount of eth adjusted by the difference between initial eth value and strike price
 Therefore, it have to be subtracted from initial deposited amount of eth
 But instead we subtracted from half of initial amount of eth
 calculateCollateralToReturn()
 ```solidity
 collateralToReturn = calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) - collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
 ```
  inside Treasury.sol withdraw()
  ```solidity
  uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
            uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate; //@audit triple check
            // Transfer collateral to user
            bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
```
We see that amount being subtracted from half of deposited collateral, in this part, as we can see, protocol will charged more upsides than it expected

### Root Cause

BorrowLib() calculateCollateralToReturn()

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1)user borrowing funds and putting erc20 collateral
2)user withdrawing less collateral then it should be

### Impact

User lose funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


```solidity
collateralToReturn = calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralRemainingInWithdraw);
```
