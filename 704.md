# Users can escape from liquidations

### Summary

A user can escape getting liquidated through `liquidationType1`. This occurs as if `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` remains 0, the msg.value of the call is sent to the liquidated user. This is problematic as if the user is a smart contract they can cause the call to revert, preventing the liquidation.

Furthermore, the refund should not be sent to the liquidated user as they are not the ones making the call, but it should instead be refunded to the caller. 

### Root Cause

In `borrowLiquidation.liquidationType1` the unused msg.value is refunded to the liquidated user instead of the admin.
