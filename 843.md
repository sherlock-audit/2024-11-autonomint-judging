# Incorrect USDa Yield Redemption Due to Failure to Update `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` in Liquidation Process

### Summary
the `BorrowLiquidation` contract was intended to ensure that the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable in the Treasury contract is updated during the `liquidation process`. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the calculations in the `redeemYields` function of the BorrowLib library

There is potential calculation errors in the `redeemYields` function of the BorrowLib library, which relies on this `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable to determine the amount of USDa that can be transferred to users.

### Vulnerability Detail
The potential vulnerability arises from the fact that if the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable is not updated during the `liquidation` process, it could lead to incorrect calculations in the `Borrowlib::redeemYields` function. This could result in Users receive zero USDa tokens when they attempt to redeem their yields.

### Impact
If the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable is not updated:

Users may experience discrepancies in the amount of USDa they expect to receive when redeeming their yields, leading to frustration and loss of trust in the system.

Financial Losses: Users could potentially lose out on yields they are entitled to, which could result in financial losses.

### PoC
In the [Borrowlib::redeemYield](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1002) function, we have the following lines of code:  

```javascript
uint128 usdaToAbondRatioLiq = uint128((treasury.usdaGainedFromLiquidation() * RATE_PRECISION) / abond.totalSupply());
uint256 usdaToTransfer = (usdaToAbondRatioLiq * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION;
```

Since the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable is not updated and is currently set to zero, the calculation of `usdaToAbondRatioLiq` will result in zero. Consequently, the calculation of `usdaToTransfer`, which depends on `usdaToAbondRatioLiq`, will also result in zero. This means that no USDa will be transferred to the user, resulting in the user not receiving any gains from liquidation as intended.

### Mitigation
Update the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable  in liquidation functions.
