# borrowing::executeOrdersInSynthetix will be reverted because of incorrect fee value

### Summary

`borrowing::executeOrdersInSynthetix` will be reverted because of incorrect fee value

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L385

as we can see fee value hardcoded 1 in `BorrowLiquidation::executeOrdersInSynthetix` and this causes executeOrdersInSynthetix will be reverted



### PoC

https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/de2b994cc8064301288e7619042287cddb7c6753/contracts/PerpsV2ExchangeRate.sol#L94
```solidity
        uint fee = offchainOracle().getUpdateFee(priceUpdateData);
        require(msg.value >= fee, "Not enough eth for paying the fee");
```

as we can see in above code msg.value should be greater than updateFee otherwise transaction will be reverted

### Impact

`borrowing::executeOrdersInSynthetix` will be reverted because of incorrect fee value

### Mitigation

consider to pass enough msg.value to cover update fee
