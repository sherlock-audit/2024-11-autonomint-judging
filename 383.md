# Malicious user can benefit from `redeemUSDT`

### Summary

In the current logic in `CDS::redeemUSDT` users can pass for the prices arbitrary parameters. This will lead into a situation where users can sell small amount of usda tokens for much more usdt tokens. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506-L524

### Root Cause

The problem here lays in the function structure and more precisely in the function params: 
```solidity
function redeemUSDT(
        uint128 usdaAmount,
        uint64 usdaPrice,
        uint64 usdtPrice
    ) 
```

As we can see users can pass any values for usdaPrice and usdtPrice, and inflating the price.
The below line calculates the usdtAmount that user will receive and if user sets high value for the usdaPrice and low value for the usdtPrice, he will benefit from that.
```solidity
uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Let's look at the following example:
1. User has 1 usda token and call redeemUsdt with usdaAmount = 1, usdaPrice = 100 and usdtToken = 1.
2. In that case user will receive 100 usdt tokens.
3. User will make 100x of their token.


### Impact

Users can sell small value of usda for high value of usdt tokens. It is expected in the protocol the usda to have 1:1 with the usdt. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider removing these two params and enforce 1:1 mapping between usda and usdt.
