# CDSLib.sol#_withdraw - `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` should be reduced only by funds withdrawn from the chain

### Summary

`totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` holds all of the deposited amounts on the chain and it is decreased on `_witthdraw`. However, the variable is incorrectly calculated by directly subtracting `returnAmount` and `optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain` although it should subtract only the withdrawn funds from the chain.




### Root Cause

`totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` holds all of the deposited amount on the chain. The protocols work on multiple chains, so on liquidation or withdraw, if there are not enough funds on the chain, funds from the other chain are get.
In [withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L865-L919) when funds are withdrawn, `totalCdsDepositedAmount` should be decreased but we will focus on the `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` variable:
```js
        totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= params.returnAmount - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain;
```
- `returnAmount` is the amount returned to the user including the `optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain`;
- `optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain` holds what amount was taken from the other chain. 

The problem is how the `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` is decreased. From `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` should be subtracted **only the funds from this chain**. The `returnAmoun` includes `optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain` and by subtracting the entire `returnAmount`, the protocol deducts the `optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain` twice. 

Let's illustrate it with an example:
```js
        totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= params.returnAmount - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain;
```
`totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= 1000 - 200` => `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= 1200` 
However, in the correct logic, only `800` should be decreased as that was withdrawn from this chain. , it
