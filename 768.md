# `borrowing::calculateCumulativeRate()` is called after the deposit/withdrawal, leading to incorrect debt amounts

### Summary

`borrowing::calculateCumulativeRate()` [updates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L530) the debt amount of each borrower, increased [over time](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L536), which means that it must be updated before each interaction by a borrower. However, depositing/withdrawing update the rate after the debt is calculated and realized, taking losses/profits.

### Root Cause

In `borrowing.sol:257/704`, the debt rate is computed after the deposit/withdrawal calculations.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits 10 ETH and borrows 8000 USDa at a price of 1000 USD / 1 ETH. Consider that the lastCumulativeRate is 1, so the `normalizedAmount` is 8000.
2. debt increases for example 0.03% daily and 1 day passes
3. user withdraws, repaying the same 8000 USDa (rate is still 1 at the calculation) instead of 8000*10003/10000 = 8002.4` USD.

### Impact

Protocol suffers losses as borrowers pay less debt.

### PoC

See links above.

### Mitigation

Calculate the rate before depositing/withdrawing.
