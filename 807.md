# `Treasury::totalInterestFromLiquidation` can not be withdrawn

### Summary

`Treasury::withdrawInterest()` [withdraws](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L622) interest from borrower debt withdrawals and liquidations, but only the interest from withdrawals is redeemable. 

### Root Cause

In `Treasury.sol:622`, the amount is always withdrawn from `totalInterest`, so `totalInterestFromLiquidation` is not withdrawable.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Liquidations happen and interest is [added](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L272), but only the interest from withdrawals is redeemable.

### Impact

Stuck interest from debt liquidations.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Add a separate method to withdraw interest from liquidations.
