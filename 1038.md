# Malicious Actors Can Exploit Incorrect USDa-USDT Price in redeemUSDT Function to Drain Funds

### Summary

In the `redeemUSDT` function of the CDS contract, the USDA and USDT prices are supplied by the user without any validation for accuracy. This lack of verification allows an attacker to input fraudulent USDA-USDT prices, enabling them to withdraw more USDT than they are entitled to, which could result in the draining of the protocol's funds.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

An attacker can exploit the `redeemUSDT` function of the CDS contract by providing incorrect USDA and USDT prices as parameters. The function calculates the USDT value based on these user-provided inputs, and since there is no validation of their accuracy, the attacker can manipulate the values. This allows the attacker to receive an inflated amount of USDT, potentially draining the protocol’s funds.

### Impact

The attacker can drain the protocol’s funds by providing incorrect USDA and USDT prices, exploiting the lack of price validation in the `redeemUSDT` function. This allows the attacker to withdraw more USDT than intended, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The protocol should not rely on user-inputted prices and instead utilize oracle prices for price validation. This would ensure that the USDA and USDT prices used in the `redeemUSDT` function are accurate and prevent attackers from exploiting incorrect price inputs to drain the protocol’s funds.
