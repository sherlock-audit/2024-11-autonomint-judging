# There is no check for prices last updated time in oracles

### Summary

The contract currently lacks a mechanism to ensure that prices fetched from the Chainlink and Redstone oracle are up-to-date. In scenarios where the Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) protocol fails to update prices in a timely manner, stale price data could be used inadvertently. This could potentially lead to incorrect contract operations, including mispriced transactions.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

users can exploit outdated prices .

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this, consider incorporating a staleness threshold (defined in seconds) into the contract configuration. This would enforce that any price data used is within this specified freshness timeframe, thereby ensuring the contract only operates with relevant and recent price information.

 ```diff
 - (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
 + (, int256 price_, ,uint256 updatedAt_, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
 + require(block.timestamp - updatedAt_ <= 10 * 60, "Price updated at more than threshold")  // 10 mins for example
 ```
