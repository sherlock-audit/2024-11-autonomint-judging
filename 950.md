# User will not recive any USDa token in `borrowing::redeemYields`

### Summary

The `BorrowLiquidation` contract is designed to ensure that the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable in the Treasury contract is updated during the liquidation process. As this is important for preserving the accuracy of calculations `usdaToTransfer` in the `redeemYields` function of the BorrowLib.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the scenario where the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` state variable in treasury is not updated anywhere in the liquidation process or anywhere  else in whole contract because there is not a single instance where function `updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation` is been called. So therefore value of `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` will be always = 0

```solidity
uint256 public usdaGainedFromLiquidation;

function updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(uint256 amount, bool operation) external onlyCoreContracts {
        if (operation) {
            usdaGainedFromLiquidation += amount;
        } else {
            //@audit BUG THIS will ALWAYAS be 0 because because this function is not updated in any function from all over the protocol

            usdaGainedFromLiquidation -= amount;
        }
    }

```


Now because `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` = 0 , therefore calculation of ` usdaToTransfer` in the `BorrowLib::redeemYields` function will become 0. As a result, users will not receive any USDa tokens when redeeming their yields.

```solidity
int128 usdaToAbondRatioLiq =
            uint128((treasury.usdaGainedFromLiquidation() * RATE_PRECISION) / abond.totalSupply());
            
      uint256 usdaToTransfer = (usdaToAbondRatioLiq * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION; 
            
         if (usdaToTransfer > 0) {
            // transfer usda to user
            bool transferred = usda.contractTransferFrom(address(treasury), user, usdaToTransfer);
            if (!transferred) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_TransferFailed();
        }           
```

### Impact

Financial Losses: Users will not receive an any amount of USDa tokens, leading to loss of user's yield in USDa token, as `usdaToTransfer` = 0 always.

```solidity

  if (usdaToTransfer > 0) {
            // transfer usda to user
            bool transferred = usda.contractTransferFrom(address(treasury), user, usdaToTransfer);
            if (!transferred) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_TransferFailed();
        }
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update function `updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation` in the liquidation process.
