# The attacker will prevent any SetterFunction by calling MultiSign::executeSetterFunction before the admin calls it

### Summary

The [MultiSign::executeSetterFunction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304) function is vulnerable to abuse because it is an external function that allows anyone to call if its status is `getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals`. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling `executeSetterFunction `whenever a set function is available to be executed.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the design of the function:

1. The function is external, meaning it can be called by anyone.
2. When called, it checks the `getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals`, then changes approvedToUpdate from true to false. This occurs in a temporary state before the admin calls setter functions like `Borrowing::setAPR`.
3. This creates a window of opportunity for a DoS attack.
4. As a result, setter functions will always revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

There must be a state with `getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals`.

### External pre-conditions

The attacker needs to monitor the contract to identify when `getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals`

Then, they must execute `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction` before the admin calls setter functions such as `Borrowing::setAPR`.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker monitors the contract to detect when a `getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals` state.
2. As soon as this state, the attacker calls the `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction`function.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to disrupt the entire system by preventing any set function from executing.

### Mitigation

Add access control to `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction`.
