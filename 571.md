# No check if Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds `MasterPriceOracle.sol`

### Summary

No check if Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds `MasterPriceOracle.sol`

### Root Cause

Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle.

If the Optimism Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. However, users are able to continue to interact with the protocol directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contract. You can review Chainlink docs on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/) for more details on this.

This protocol uses `price()` everywhere . As a result, users may be able to use the protocol while Oracle feeds are stale. This could cause many problems, for example:

The user's deposit 1 ETH at the price of 1900 usd.
The current market price is 2200 USD/WETH.

However, due to an outdated price of 1800 USD/WETH, the user can withdraw 1 ETH, without share profit for Eth price going raise.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The Optimism sequencer goes down temporarily.

### Attack Path

The attacker exploits previous (stale) prices to execute withdraw() favorable to themselves, resulting in losses for the other user.

### Impact

The protocol may incur financial losses as a result.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refer to[Example code](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)to use the sequencerUptimeFeed.
