### Root Cause

dust amounts will be removed in OFT tokens
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L779

### PoC
https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart#token-transfer-precision

>The OFT Standard also handles differences in decimal precision before every cross-chain transfer by "cleaning" the amount from any decimal precision that cannot be represented in the shared system.
>The OFT Standard defines these small token transfer amounts as "dust".

when CDS depositors want to withdraw their assets from CDS contract also they get their share from liquidations amounts and if current chain dosen't have enough liquidity to send to user the protocol get need amount from other chain and let's assume needed amount is 1234567890123456789 rsETH and `CDS::withdraw` send message to other chain for getting need amount but because of remove dust amount 1234567000000000000 rsETH received from other chains and this causes treasury doesn't have enough rsETH to cover withdraw transaction

### Impact
Breaks core contract functionality

### Mitigation
consider to remove dust amount before send message to other chains
