# Potentially improper initialization of `Treasury.sol` may lead to address(0)

### Summary

For some reason there is [missing checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L100) for the last two addressed, that are `usdtAddress` and `globalVariablesAddress`. This could theoretically lead to the following scenario:

Code:

```solidity
function initialize(
        address borrowingAddress,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address cdsContractAddress,
        address borrowLiquidationAddress,
        address usdtAddress,
        address globalVariablesAddress
    ) public initializer {
        address[7] memory addresses = [
            borrowingAddress,
            usdaAddress,
            abondAddress,
            cdsContractAddress,
            borrowLiquidationAddress,
     @> usdtAddress,
     @> globalVariablesAddress
        ];

        for (uint8 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            if (addresses[i] == address(0) || !isContract(addresses[i])) revert Treasury_CantBeEOAOrZeroAddress(addresses[i]);
        }
```

### Root Cause

The for loop should iterate through all 7 elements of the`addresses` variable.
