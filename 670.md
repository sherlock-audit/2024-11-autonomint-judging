# Calling `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation()` in `BorrowLib.redeemYields()` will always revert  redeemYields  process due to underflow

### Summary

Possible reverts due to subtraction of non-zero value from 0.

### Root Cause

`treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation()` is never called in any of the liquidation process in borrowLiquidation.sol 
```solidity
   function updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(
        uint256 amount,
        bool operation
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
        if (operation) {
            usdaGainedFromLiquidation += amount;
        } else {
            usdaGainedFromLiquidation -= amount;
        }
    }
```

hence the value of `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` at the time `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation()` is called in `BorrowLib.redeemYields()` will be 0 causing reverts due to underflow

```solidity
   function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {
      /// skip
        treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false);

      /// skip

```


### Internal pre-conditions

value of `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` will be == 0

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation()` is called [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1005) in `BorrowLib.redeemYields()`, there will be reverts due to underflow as a result of attempting to subtract a non-zero value from 0

RedeemYields process will always revert due to underflow

### PoC

search for  where `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation()` is called in the entire liquidation process in borrowLiquidation.sol, you wont see it anywhere. The function was never called in any of the liquidation process.

### Mitigation

Make sure `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation()` is called in the liquidation process so that `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` will be a non-zero value.
