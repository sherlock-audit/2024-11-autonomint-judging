# Mismanagement of Treasury Interest in treasury `withdrawInterest` Function

### Summary

The `withdrawInterest` function has critical flaws in its deduction logic. It only deducts withdrawal amounts from `totalInterest`, completely ignoring `totalInterestFromLiquidation`. Additionally, there are no mechanisms to deduct from `totalInterestFromLiquidation`, causing these funds to become inaccessible. This results in unnecessary reverts during withdrawals and renders a portion of the treasury funds unusable.

### Root Cause

1. The function logic does not account for the combined total of totalInterest and totalInterestFromLiquidation when checking withdrawal feasibility.

2. No operations or functions in the system update or reduce totalInterestFromLiquidation, leaving it stuck indefinitely.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. **Funds Inaccessibility:**
Treasury funds from totalInterestFromLiquidation are stuck, leading to inefficiency in managing the protocol's resources.

2. **Unnecessary Reverts:**
Withdrawals fail even when the treasury has sufficient funds across both variables, causing operational disruptions and loss of user trust.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix Deduction Logic: Update the function to consider both `totalInterest` and `totalInterestFromLiquidation` during withdrawal.
```diff
require(
    amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),
    "Treasury doesn't have enough interest"
);

if (amount <= totalInterest) {
    totalInterest -= amount;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = amount - totalInterest;
    totalInterest = 0;
    totalInterestFromLiquidation -= remaining;
}

```
