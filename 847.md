# `CDS.sol::updateDownsideProtected()` can be called by anyone, with anyvalue changeing the state variable `downsideProtected`.

### Summary

Anyone can call `CDS.sol::updateDownsideProtected()` and modify the state of blockchain, by altering `downsideProtected`.

### Root Cause

Not checking who's the caller of this function or implanting any kind of modifier to verify the caller.

### Attack Path

1. `downsideProtected` is being used in `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` and `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` is being called in both `withdraw()` and `deposit()` functions.

```js
    function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
            totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }
```

2. when `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` is executed it updates 2 another state variables -

`totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`

and also these 2 varibles are being used in `deposit()` and `withdraw()`function.

3. let's consider in `deposit()` function `totalCdsDepositedAmount` being updated as -

`totalCdsDepositedAmount = result.totalCdsDepositedAmount;`

4. But later on in `withdraw()` function `totalCdsDepositedAmount` being used for is manimpulated one, as a malicious user has called `updateDownsideProtected`. -

```js
        withdrawResult = CDSLib.withdrawUser(
            WithdrawUserParams(
                cdsDepositDetails,
                omniChainData,
                optionFees,
                optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain,
                returnAmount,
                withdrawResult.ethAmount,
                withdrawResult.usdaToTransfer,
                weETH_ExchangeRate,
                rsETH_ExchangeRate,
                fee.nativeFee
            ),
            Interfaces(
                treasury,
                globalVariables,
                usda,
                usdt,
                borrowing,
                CDSInterface(address(this))
            ),
            totalCdsDepositedAmount, // manipulated
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees,
            omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo
        );

```

### Impact

Can lead to loss of user funds to to manipulated values of `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`

### Mitigation

Restrict the visibilty of `CDS.sol::updateDownsideProtected()` or check who's the caller of this function.
