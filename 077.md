# updateDownsideProtected function lacks access control

### Summary

The CDS contract  updateDownsideProtected function lacks proper access control, allowing any user to update the `downsideProtected` value arbitrarily. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, disrupting deposits and withdrawals.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the vulnerability is the absence of access control in the updateDownsideProtected function. Any user can call this function and increase downsideProtected without restriction.

```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```

Setting `downsideProtected` higher than `totalCdsDepositedAmount` would DOS deposit and withdrawals because of underflow. 
```solidity
    function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
            totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
```

Or setting lower values would make `totalCdsDepositedAmount` different and broke the all contract calculations



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls updateDownsideProtected with a very high value.
2. The _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount function reduces totalCdsDepositedAmount by downsideProtected, causing setting the value to zero.
3. withdrawals and other operations fail due to incorrect values in totalCdsDepositedAmount, breaking core protocol logic.

### Impact

Deposits and withdrawals are disrupted.
The total deposited amount is manipulated, causing incorrect calculations throughout the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict updateDownsideProtected to only authorized borrowing contract
