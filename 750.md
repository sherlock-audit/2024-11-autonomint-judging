# Liquidation profit is never given to cds depositors who will take these losses

### Summary

Liquidation profit is calculated in `borrowingLiquidation::liquidationType1()`, but is actually never handled and given to cds depositors. It is [stored](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L221) and added to `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, but it is missing the functionality to send the profits to cds depositors in [CDSLib::withdrawUser()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L639-L663).

### Root Cause

In `CDSLib::withdrawUser()`, the cds profits stored in `omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo` are not given to the cds depositors.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower is liquidated, cds profits are calculated but when the cds depositors withdraw, they do not receive these profits.

### Impact

Cds depositors take losses on liquidation instead of profiting.

### PoC

See the links above.

### Mitigation

Calculate the share of the profits and send to the cds depositors.
