# LayerZero Message Delays Can Cause Protocol Issues Through Cross-Chain State Desynchronization

### Summary

 Inherent time taken for LayerZero message propagation will cause protocol state desynchronization for Autonomint.

### Root Cause

The choice to rely on asynchronous LayerZero messages for cross-chain state updates creates exploitable timing windows where protocol state is inconsistent across chains.

### Attack Path

One such path at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Options.sol#L121

Chain A has inflated CDS/ETH vault ratio due to stale data
User deposits on Chain A, receiving artificially low options fees
User locks in cheap downside protection based on incorrect risk assessment
Protection remains active even after states sync



### Impact

The core issue manifests in multiple ways because critical protocol functions depend on synchronized cross-chain state and cause protocol instability and loss of funds.
