# Precision Loss Due to Integer Division Truncation in `BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond` Function

### Summary

Integer division truncation in [`BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L143) will cause an inaccurate return amount for the treasury as the liquidation process will miscalculate the remaining funds due to precision loss in intermediate calculations.

### Root Cause

In `liquidation.sol:143`, the intermediate results of the calculation are truncated due to integer division, causing cumulative precision loss in the final return amount calculation.

This is because each division discards the fractional remainder instead of deferring the division to a later step or using a higher-precision scaling mechanism.

This function is a vital function, which is also called in [`liquidationType1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L209-L210)

### Attack Path

1. Initial Calculation:
The function starts with `depositedAmount * depositEthPrice`, a multiplication step that does not introduce any precision issues.

2. Division by USDA_PRECISION:

3. The result is divided by `USDA_PRECISION.` If the numerator `(depositedAmount * depositEthPrice`) is not a perfect multiple of `USDA_PRECISION`, the fractional part is truncated.
Division by 100:

4. The truncated result from the previous step is further divided by 100. This compounds the precision loss, as the already truncated value undergoes another division.
Subtraction of `returnToTreasury:`

5. The truncated value is reduced by `returnToTreasury`. Although subtraction does not introduce additional truncation, the errors from earlier steps propagate here.
Final Multiplication and Division `(* 10 / 100):`

6. Multiplying by 10 restores some scale, but the subsequent division by 100 introduces another truncation step, compounding the precision loss even further.
These repeated truncations lead to a cumulative error in the calculated return value, resulting in an inaccurate amount returned to the treasury.

### Mitigation

The most effective way to mitigate the precision loss is to defer all divisions until the final step of the calculation. This ensures that intermediate results retain full precision and truncation occurs only once.
