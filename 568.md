# USDT is expected to return a bool, preventing users from depositing into CDS

### Summary

In the CDSLib.sol contract when users deposit to CDS, USDT is trasnferred from the user to the contract. The issue is that it is expected for USDT to return a boolean, depending on the success of the transfer. This will cause all deposits to revert as USDT does not return any value.

### Root Cause
