# During withdraw in borrow, downsideProtected is not deducted

### Summary

In the current implementation during borrow withdraw, the total debt is calculated. If the price went down after the borrow deposit, downside protected will be >0 and users will have smaller debt to repay, because downside protected should be deducted from the debt, but this is not done.

### Root Cause

In the current implementation there is a missing deduction in the code during the `transferFrom`:

```solidity
bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
                    (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral
                );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the price went down since the borrow deposit, they are eligible for some downsideProtected. And users will need to pay higher debt, because downsideProtected is not deducted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following change to the code:
```diff
bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
+                  (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral - downsideProtected
-                  (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral
 );
```
