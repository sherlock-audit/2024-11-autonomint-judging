# Potential for Insufficient Ether Balance During Liquidation Process

### Summary

In the `BorrowLiquidation` contract, the `liquidationType2` function assumes the contract holds sufficient Ether balance to perform a WETH deposit equivalent to half of the user's deposited ETH amount. However, there is no guarantee or mechanism ensuring the contract's Ether balance matches this requirement. If the balance is insufficient, the `weth.deposit` call will fail, causing the liquidation process to revert and potentially leaving undercollateralized positions open, increasing the protocol's risk.

### Root Cause

The `liquidationType2` function calculates an `amount` based on the user's deposited ETH and attempts to deposit this amount into the WETH contract without verifying the contract's Ether balance. Since the function does not receive Ether (`msg.value`), and there are no preceding transfers to the contract, the required balance may not be available.

```solidity

function liquidationType2(
    address user,
    uint64 index,
    uint64 currentEthPrice
) internal {
    // ...
    uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);

    // Convert the ETH into WETH
    weth.deposit{value: amount}(); // Potentially fails if insufficient balance

    // ...
}

```

### Attack Path

While not directly exploitable by an attacker, the inability to liquidate positions due to balance issues can lead to systemic risks:

1. An undercollateralized position is identified for liquidation using `liquidationType2`.
2. The contract attempts to execute the liquidation but fails due to insufficient Ether balance.
3. The position remains open, potentially leading to further insolvency if the asset value continues to decline.

### Impact

 Inability to liquidate positions

### PoC


1. **Underfunded Contract:**

   - The `BorrowLiquidation` contract has an Ether balance less than the required `amount`.

2. **Attempted Liquidation:**

   ```solidity
   borrowLiquidation.liquidateBorrowPosition(
       userAddress,
       index,
       currentEthPrice,
       IBorrowing.LiquidationType.TWO,
       lastCumulativeRate
   );
   ```

3. **Function Reverts:**

   - The `weth.deposit{value: amount}()` call fails due to insufficient funds.
   - The liquidation process cannot proceed.

### Mitigation

- **Ensure Sufficient Ether Balance:**

  Before attempting the WETH deposit, confirm that the contract has the necessary Ether balance.

  ```solidity
  require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient Ether balance for liquidation.");
  ```

- **Refactor Ether Handling:**

  Modify the liquidation process to transfer the required Ether to the contract before the `weth.deposit` call.

  - From `Borrowing` contract, send the needed Ether when calling `liquidateBorrowPosition`:

    ```solidity
    borrowLiquidation.liquidateBorrowPosition{value: amountRequired}(/* parameters */);
    ```
