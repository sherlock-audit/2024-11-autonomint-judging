# Synthethix is not deployed on Mode

### Summary

Synthethix is used when liquidating a user in the borrowingLiquidation.sol contract and in several other functions of borrowing.sol. The issue is that Synthethix is not deployed on the Mode blockchain, causing liquidations to fail to be made and some functions to not be usable.

### Root Cause

Synthethix is expected to be supported by the protocol for one of the types of liquidations, however, it is currently not deployed on Mode, and thus, some functionalities of the protocol will not be usable.

Here we can see that Mode is not supported:

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Owner attempts to liquidate a user through the second liquidation type.
2. However, the call is made on Mode and it reverts, as Synthethix is not deployed on Mode.

### Impact

Vital functionalities of borrowing.sol and borrowingLiquidation.sol become unusuable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is non-trivial.
