# Incorrect Approval Amount in `Treasury.transferFundsToGlobal()` will disrupt withdrawal functionality for Borrowers

### Summary

In, `Treasury.transferFundsToGlobal()`, the use of `transferAmounts[1]` (associated with WeETH) for approval and `transferAmounts[2]` (associated with WrsETH) for withdrawal causes a mismatch in asset handling. This discrepancy can lead to failure of transfer the tokens  to Global variables contract.


### Root Cause

The `if (i == 2)` block in the `transferFundsToGlobal()` function of the `Treasury` contract aims to send `rsETH` to the global variable contract by unwrapping `wrsETH` (wrapped rsETH). 

```solidity
                // Transfer tokens if the index not equal to 0, since index 0 is ETH
                if (i != 0) {
                    if (i == 2) {
@>                      if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
                        IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
                        assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
                    }
                    bool success = IERC20(assetAddress).transfer(msg.sender, transferAmounts[i]); 
                    if (!success) revert Treasury_TransferFailed();
                } else {
```

However, the approval amount for unwrapping is incorrectly set to `transferAmounts[1]` (associated with WeETH) instead of the correct `transferAmounts[2]` (associated with wrsETH). This leads to a logical error, causing potential transaction failures and revertion in `GlobalVariables._lzReceive()`

### Attack Path

While executing `Borrowing.withDraw()`, if there is a downside, it will covered via the CDS mechanism through the LayerZero protocol.

```solidity
        // if there is a downside, get it from cds
        {if (result.downsideProtected > 0) {
@>          _getDownsideFromCDS(result.downsideProtected, msg.value - fee.nativeFee);
        } else {
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L686C1-L689C10

```solidity
    function _getDownsideFromCDS(
        uint128 downsideProtected,
        uint256 feeForOFT
    ) internal {
        if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
            // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
@>          globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: feeForOFT}(
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
                IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),downsideProtected - cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()),
                // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
                IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
                IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_WITHDRAW,
                msg.sender
            );

When a cross-chain message is received in `GlobalVariables`,  the [_lzReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L531) function is executed. If the FunctionToDo value is COLLATERAL_TRANSFER or BOTH_TRANSFER, it triggers a call to treasury.transferFundsToGlobal().

```solidity
            // Get the funds from treasury, since the sender is global variables contract
            treasury.transferFundsToGlobal([
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.weETHToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.rsETHToSend,
                    oappData.oftTransferData.tokensToSend
                ]
            );
```

When i == 2, in the `transferFundsToGlobal()` function intends to:

	1.	Approve the `transferAmounts[2]` (amount of wrsETH) for the wrsETH contract to allow unwrapping.
	2.	Call `wrsETH.withdraw()` to unwrap wrsETH into rsETH.
	3.	Transfer the resulting rsETH to the global variable contract.

However, the approval step mistakenly uses `transferAmounts[1]` (corresponding to WeETH) instead of the correct `transferAmounts[2]`.

This will cause reversion layer zero interactions.

### Impact

Due to this incorrect approval amount for unwrapping wrsETH, it will directly affect the functionality of the `Borrowing.withdraw()` process. Borrowers will be unable to withdraw their assets if the funds cannot be successfully transferred to the global contract.

### Mitigation

```diff
                // Transfer tokens if the index not equal to 0, since index 0 is ETH
                if (i != 0) {
                    if (i == 2) {
-                       if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
+                       if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[2])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
                        IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
                        assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
                    }
                    bool success = IERC20(assetAddress).transfer(msg.sender, transferAmounts[i]); 
                    if (!success) revert Treasury_TransferFailed();
                } else {
