# ChainlinkOracle Does Not Verify If the Returned Price Is Outside the Min/Max Range in MasterPriceOracle

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators feature a built-in circuit breaker mechanism that activates if an asset's price exceeds a predefined range. Consequently, if an asset undergoes a massive devaluation (e.g., the LUNA collapse), the oracle price will continue to return the `minPrice` rather than the actual asset price.

This allows users to continue borrowing against the asset at an incorrect price, potentially leading to protocol exploitation. This exact scenario occurred with [Venus](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/), a lending platform on BSC, during the LUNA crash. Because the protocol lacked the necessary checks to prevent such issues.

Below is the ETH/USD price feed example used by the protocol on Optimism, which returns `minAnswer`:

[ETH/USD minAnswer = 1000000000](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9#readContract)

## Root Cause
In the [MasterPriceOracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83), the code does not validate the `minAnswer` for specific tokens, nor does it revert when the oracle provides this value.

## Internal Pre-conditions

## External Pre-conditions
The token's price falls below the `minAnswer`.

## Attack Path
1. The token's price drops below the `minAnswer`.
2. The attacker deposits the token as collateral at the inflated `minAnswer` price provided by Chainlink.
3. The attacker borrows the maximum allowable amount for another asset. This results in the borrowed asset being worth more than the collateral, causing protocol insolvency.

## Impact
- Attackers can borrow assets worth more than the collateral, resulting in:
- Significant financial losses for the protocol.
- Accumulation of bad debt.

## POC

## Mitigation
Retrieve both the `minPrice` and `maxPrice` from the Chainlink aggregator and compare them with the returned price. Revert the transaction if the price falls outside the allowed bounds.
