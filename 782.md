# `Borrowing::redeemYields` is prone to re-entrancy vulnerability, draining all ETH from the Treasury contract.

### Summary

The `Borrowing::redeemYields` function in the is responsible for allowing users to redeem their ABOND tokens for ETH yields from an external protocol. 

However, it is currently vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks due to the lack of a `nonReentrant` modifier and the fact that the user's state is not updated before making an external call.


### Root Cause


Two main reasons re-entrancy is happening: 
1. `nonReentrant` modifier is missing in user calling function [Borrowing::redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L318)
and `nonReentrant` modifier is also missing on the external calling [(bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L292) function from where the re-entrancy will happen [Treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L703)

2.  [State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L990), ie. the state of the user's ABOND tokens is NOT at all updated in whole function flow, and therefore in treasury function `withdrawFromExternalProtocol` due this arbitrary external call `(bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");`  Attacker can re-enter the same  `Borrowing::redeemYields` , which will ultimately drain the ETH in Treasury contract.


### Internal pre-conditions

- attacker has to set a contract re-entrancy contract, that will call `Borrowing::redeemYields` functions in fallback function when eth is sent to it. 
- Attacker first has to deposit ETH in borrowing.sol
- Attacket then needs to withdraw in borrowing.sol, so that now he has a balance of abond token -> `userState.aBondBalance` (here, `toAddress` in input param will not be this contract's address, to avoid revert)

### Attack Path

- attacker has to set a contract re-entrancy contract, that will call `Borrowing::redeemYields` functions in fallback function when eth is sent to it. 

Flow of re-entrancy attack, where it will not revert anywhere in the whole flow ->

1.  [Borrowing::redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L318) -> 
2. [BorrowLib::redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1029) -> 
3. [treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L290) -> 
4. [withdrawFromIonicByUser](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L703)
5. And then re-enter in `Borrowing::redeemYields` functions again from this external call -> [(bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L292)


### Impact

The attacker can drain all ETH from the Treasury contract, potentially causing significant financial loss to the protocol and it's other users as now they won't be able to redeem their yeilds as ETH in treasury got drained due to a re-entrancy attack.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


1. apply `nonReentrant` modifier on function `Borrowing::redeemYields` and `Treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol`

2. Update user's states before the external call happens, ie. subtract the `userState.aBondBalance` of the user before this line - `uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user, aBondAmount);` inside `BorrowLib::redeemYields` executes.
