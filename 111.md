# `ChainlinkOracle` doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer


## Vulnerability
The `MasterPriceOracle.sol` contract specially the `_price` function using the aggregatorv3 to call the `latestRoundData`. the function should check for the min and max amount return to prevent some case happen, something like this:

<https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-16-chainlinkadapteroracle-will-return-the-wrong-price-for-asset-if-underlying-aggregator-hits-minanswer-sherlock-blueberry-blueberry-git>

If a case like LUNA happens then the oracle will return the minimum price and not the crashed price.

Current implementation of `Chainlin Oracle` doesn't validate for the minAnswer/maxAnswer values
```javascript
   AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
```

## Impact
The wrong price may be returned in the event of a market crash. An adversary will then be able to borrow against the wrong price and incur bad debt to the protocol.

## Tool Used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
If the price is outside the minPrice/maxPrice of the oracle, activate a breaker to reduce further losses.
```javascript
 require(price < _maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
 require(price > _minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");
```
