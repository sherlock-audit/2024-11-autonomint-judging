# Downside Protection Failure in BorrowLib::withdraw Function

## Summary  
The protocol promises downside protection of up to 20% for ETH depositors at withdrawal. However, the implementation in the `BorrowLib::withdraw` function contains a critical flaw. While the `downsideProtected` amount is correctly calculated based on the user's deposited ETH and subtracted from the total debt in the global state variables at [this point](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L840) and [this point](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L873C15-L875C18), it is not deducted during the debt repayment process at [this point](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L877C15-L882C19).

As a result, the downside protection mechanism fails to function as intended, and users do not receive the protection against losses as promised. Additionally, this miscalculation causes inconsistencies in the state variables and omnichain data, as the total debt repaid by borrowers is inaccurately reflected by the protocol.

## Root Cause  
The `downsideProtected` amount is not properly deducted from the total debt when the debt is repaid to the treasury within the `BorrowLib::withdraw` function. This oversight disables the downside protection feature, failing to provide the intended safeguard for depositors.

## Internal Preconditions  
## External Preconditions  
- The ETH value at the time of withdrawal must be at least 20% lower than its value at the time of deposit, making the user eligible for downside protection.
  
## Attack Path  
1. When the ETH price falls to 80% or less of its value at the time of deposit, the `downsideProtected` amount is correctly calculated. However, during the debt repayment process, this amount is not deducted as intended.  
2. As a result, the protocol incorrectly updates the global state and omnichain data, subtracting the `downsideProtected` amount from the recorded debt but not from the actual debt repayment process.

## Impact  
- **Failure to provide downside protection**: Users are not protected against losses, which undermines trust in the protocol.  
- **Inconsistent state updates**: The incorrect deduction of the `downsideProtected` amount leads to discrepancies in global state variables and omnichain data.  
- **Potential financial losses**: Due to the incorrect state updates, CDS users could experience financial losses.

## POC  
## Mitigation  
To resolve this issue, the `downsideProtected` amount should be subtracted during the debt transfer to the treasury, ensuring that the protection is properly applied:
```solidity
bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
                    (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral - downsideProtected
                );
```
