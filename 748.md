# Mismatch between liquidation amount and total available reduction will lead to stuck collateral on liquidations

### Summary

`borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1()` [stores](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L229) the liquidation amount needed without considering cds profits, but [adds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L244) cds profits to `totalAvailableLiquidationAmounts`, see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L238) that cds profits are subtracted from the `cdsAmountToGetFromThisChain`.

This will lead to an incorrect share [calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L643-L648) of the collateral to receive from the liquidation, leaving it stuck.

### Root Cause

In `borrowLiquidation:229/244`, the `liquidationAmountNeeded` and `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` are modified by different amounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Cds depositor deposits 2000 USDa.
2. Two borrowers deposit 1 ETH each at a price of 1000 USD / ETH, borrowing 800 USDa each.
3. First borrower is liquidated, storing a liquidation amount needed of 820 - `(1000 - 800)*10/100 = 20` returned to abond and 800 to treasury; and `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` of `2000`.  `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` becomes `2000 - (820 - 180)) = 1360` - `cdsProfit` is `1000 - 800 - 20 = 180`.
4. Second borrower is liquidated, storing a liquidation amount needed of 820 and `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` of `1360` as calculated above.
5. cds depositor withdraws, getting a share of the collateral of the first liquidation of `2000 / 2000 = 1`. However, the liquidation amount is [reduced](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L648) by 820, the liquidation amount needed, and becomes `2000 - 820 = 1180`. The next share is given by `1180 / 1360 = 0.867`, so approximately 13% of the collateral is stuck.

### Impact

Stuck collateral.

### PoC

See the attack path.

### Mitigation

The amounts must match such that the share is correct and no collateral is stuck.
