# Concurrency issues will overwrite omnichainData and users will not be able to withdraw

### Summary

After each interaction, a cross chain transaction is sent to update the omnichain data in the other chain. However, if for example 2 deposits are made at the same time on each chain, the omnichain data will not be updated before each of the message is sent, which will overwrite information and lose it.

### Root Cause

In each interaction, the omnichain data is sent to the other chain and set, which will have concurrency issues. For example, [borrowing::depositTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L707), which will set the omnichain data [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L638).

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits 1000 cds on chain A and B.
2. User deposits 2 ETH on chain A.
3. User deposits 1 ETH on chain B at the same time.
4. As a result, `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` will be 1 ETH on chain A and 2 ETH on chain B, instead of 3.
5. User on chain A tries to withdraw, but `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` is only 1 ETH, but the deposit is 2 ETH.
Other similar attack paths are possible, leading to huge problems.

### Impact

User on chain A can not withdraw due to the incorrect `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei`.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

The omnichain data variable should be passed to the other chain as an increment, not absolute value, in order to deal with concurrency.
