# `BorrowLiquidation::liquidationType2` calculates the amount of sETH to short incorrectly when liquidating with Synthetix

### Summary

An incorrect calculation of the amount of sETH to short in `liquidationType2` will result in an inaccurate short position being opened on Synthetix, potentially leading to losses.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLiquidation.sol:363` the calculation for the amount of sETH to short uses incorrect decimals, potentially leading to an inaccurate short position.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `liquidationType` needs to be of Type 2.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The borrowing contract calls `liquidateBorrowPosition` to liquidate a borrower's position.
2. `liquidationType2` is called to handle the liquidation using Synthetix.
3. The amount of sETH to short is calculated incorrectly due to a decimals error (multiplying numerator by 1e16 instead of denominator).
4. An inaccurate short position is opened on Synthetix, potentially leading to losses for the protocol.

### Impact

The protocol may suffer losses due to the inaccurate short position opened on Synthetix.

### PoC

The issue lies within this lines of code [borrowLiquidation:L362-L365](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L362-L365):

```solidity
synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
    -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
    currentEthPrice * 1e16
);
```

This line calculates the amount of sETH to short. However, `currentEthPrice` is in 2 decimals, `margin` is in 18 decimals, and the expected output should also be in 18 decimals. 
Due to the current calculation, the output has incorrect decimals:

`(1e18 * 1e18 * 1e16 / 1e2) = 1e50`

To fix this, the calculation should be adjusted to:

```solidity
-int((uint(margin * 1 ether) / (currentEthPrice * 1e16)))
```

This corrected calculation ensures the output has the correct number of decimals (18), leading to an accurate amount of sETH being shorted.

### Mitigation

In `BorrowLiquidation.sol:363` correct the calculation for the amount of sETH to short to ensure accurate decimals. Change `-int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice))` to `-int((uint(margin * 1 ether) / (currentEthPrice * 1e16)))`.
