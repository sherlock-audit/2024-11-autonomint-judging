# Any Caller Can Burn `USDa.sol` Tokens from Approved Accounts

### Summary

The missing `onlyCoreContracts` modifier in the `contractBurnFrom` method at [`USDa.sol:170`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/USDa.sol#L170) will allow **any caller** to burn tokens from accounts with sufficient allowances, as **no checks** ensure that the caller is a contract or a specific core contract. This could result in **unauthorized token burns** and potential token loss for users.  

### Root Cause

In [`USDa.sol:170`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/USDa.sol#L170), the `contractBurnFrom` method lacks the `onlyCoreContracts` modifier. Without this, there is no validation to check if the caller is an authorized contract or even a smart contract (via `isContract`).  

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user must approve a spender (possibly malicious) using the `contractApprove` function to allow burning tokens.  
2. The approved spender has sufficient allowance to burn tokens on behalf of the user.  

### External pre-conditions

1. The protocol does not enforce restrictions on which entity can call the `contractBurnFrom` function.  

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls `contractApprove` to set themselves as a spender for an account.  
2. The attacker calls `contractBurnFrom` with the approved account as the `owner` and specifies an amount within the approved allowance.  
3. Tokens are burned from the ownerâ€™s account without additional checks or restrictions.  

### Impact

The protocol allows **any caller** to burn tokens from approved accounts, leading to potential token loss for users. An attacker could exploit this by:  
- Burning tokens without authorization.  
- Depleting the supply of tokens available to legitimate users. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the `onlyCoreContracts` modifier to the `contractBurnFrom` function to restrict its usage to authorized core contracts only. Additionally, ensure that a check like `isContract` verifies that the caller is a smart contract to avoid abuse from EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts).
