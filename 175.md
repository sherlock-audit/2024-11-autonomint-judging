# No way to retrieve sUSD margin and PNL profits from closed synthetix perpetual position

### Summary
Currently when using liquidation type 2 to liquidate a borrower we make a short perpetual position on synthetix dex, however there is no code logic to retrieve back the margin and `PNL` profits when position is closed, so funds will just be stuck.

### Root Cause
No mechanism of retrieving back the deposited funds after closing a short position, code snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L371-L375

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Submit the order in Synthetix for closing position, can only be called by Borrowing contract
     */
    function closeThePositionInSynthetix() external onlyBorrowingContract {
        (, uint128 ethPrice) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH));
        // Submit an order to close all positions in synthetix
        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(-synthetixPerpsV2.positions(address(this)).size, ethPrice * 1e16);
    }
```
As described above, positions are closed by submitting an opposite order for the entire amount currently being shorted.  
This will increase or decrease the available margin in Synthetix based on the PNL.  
However, there is no logic for withdrawing the margin back from Synthetix.

### Internal Preconditions

_No response_

### External Preconditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `LiquidationType2` is executed.
2. A short position is submitted, and the margin is deposited.
3. The short position is executed.
4. The admin attempts to cancel the short position, but the margin and PNL remain stuck in the Synthetix protocol due to missing logic to retrieve them.

### Impact
- Loss of funds, as the `sUSD` margin and `PNL` profits cannot be retrieved due to the missing withdrawal logic.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Add logic to transfer the margin back from Synthetix to the Autonomint protocol.
