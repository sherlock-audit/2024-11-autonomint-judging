# Users may be unable to witdraw from CDS if all of their deposited assets have been used for liquidations

### Summary

When depositing into CDS users can specify the part of their deposited that may be used to fulfill liquidations. It is possible to set the entire deposited amount to be eligible for that purpose. The issue is that if that occurs and the entire or almost the entire deposit is used for vault liquidations users are likely to be unable to withdraw their deposit due to an underflow.


### Root Cause

In CDSLib.withdrawUser:665 the following calculations are performed:

```solidity
    uint256 returnAmountWithGains = params.returnAmount + params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
    returnAmountWithGains -= params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount;
```
If the entire deposit amount has been used for liquidations `params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount` will be 0 and `params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount` will be the initial deposit amount.

Now if the `params.returnAmount` has experienced losses, due to the cumulative value at the time of the withdrawal being lower than the deposit cumulative value the function will revert due to an underflow.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits 100 USDT into CDS, with 100% being delegated for liquidations.
2. 100% are used for liquidations and the user is elligible to a portion of the liquidated collateral.
3. The user attempts to withdraw their deposit, however the call reverts as the cumulative value at the time of the withdrawal has decreased and their deposit has experienced losses:

### Impact

CDS depositors may be unable to withdraw their deposits and receive the liquidated collateral that they should be eligible for.

### Mitigation

Set `returnAmountWithGains` to 0 if `params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount` is higher.
