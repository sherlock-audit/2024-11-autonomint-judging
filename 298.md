# Incorrect interest handling in Treasury::withdrawInterest function

### Summary

In the `Treasury::withdrawInterest` function, the `amount` parameter is intended to allow withdrawals up to the sum of `totalInterest` and `totalInterestFromLiquidation`. However, the function only subtracts `amount` from `totalInterest`, resulting in an underflow error if `amount` exceeds `totalInterest`. This prevents the owner from withdrawing the remaining interest in `totalInterestFromLiquidation`.

[Treasury::withdrawInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L616) function:
```javascript
function withdrawInterest(
    address toAddress,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyOwner {
    require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
=>  require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
=>  totalInterest -= amount;
    bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```

### Root Cause

The logic to update `totalInterest` and `totalInterestFromLiquidation` is incorrect, as the function only updates `totalInterest` and does not account for withdrawals from `totalInterestFromLiquidation`.

### Impact

The owner is unable to withdraw the remaining interest from `totalInterestFromLiquidation`.

### Mitigation

Update the function logic to correctly account for withdrawals from both `totalInterest` and `totalInterestFromLiquidation`. For example:

```diff
function withdrawInterest(
    address toAddress,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyOwner {
    require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
    require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
-   totalInterest -= amount;
+   if (amount <= totalInterest) {
+       totalInterest -= amount;
+   } else {
+       totalInterestFromLiquidation -= (amount - totalInterest);
+       totalInterest = 0;
+   }
    bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```
