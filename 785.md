# Borrow positions with enough debt accrued over time can not be liquidated

### Summary

`borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1()` underflows whenever the debt accrued exceeds the deposited amount, [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L209). Thus, given enough time, some positions are not liquidatable, nor withdrawable, and will just lead to stuck funds if the price does not come back up to be able to withdraw (which requires a price of at least 80% of the initial amount).

### Root Cause

In `borrowingLiquidation::liquidationType1()`, the fact that the debt may exceed the deposited amount is not considered.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Borrow position is created for a long time, accruing interest.
2. Once the interest makes the debt reach the deposited value, eth price drops more than 20% and the position can not be liquidated nor withdrawn.

### Impact

Position is not withdrawable nor liquidatable and funds are stuck.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Deal with the case when the debt is bigger than the initial deposit.
