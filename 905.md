# usdaGainedFromLiquidation is not updated during liquidation, which leads to discrepancies when redeeming

### Summary

When redeeming `ABOND`, the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` value is used to calculate yield. However, this value is not updated during the liquidation process.

### Root Cause

When a borrower withdraws their position, they receive `ABOND` tokens, which can later be redeemed. Holders of `ABOND` tokens are also entitled to yield from liquidations that have occurred, but the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` value is not updated accordingly.
```solidity
    function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        // check abond amount is non zewro
        if (aBondAmount == 0) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
        IABONDToken abond = IABONDToken(abondAddress);
        // get user abond state
        //should be user but its ok.
        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
        // check user have enough abond
        if (aBondAmount > userState.aBondBalance) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InsufficientBalance();

        ITreasury treasury = ITreasury(treasuryAddress);
        // calculate abond usda ratio
@>>     uint128 usdaToAbondRatio = uint128((treasury.abondUSDaPool() * RATE_PRECISION) / abond.totalSupply());
@>>     uint256 usdaToBurn = (usdaToAbondRatio * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION;
        // update abondUsdaPool in treasury
        treasury.updateAbondUSDaPool(usdaToBurn, false);

        // calculate abond usda ratio from liquidation
@>>     uint128 usdaToAbondRatioLiq =
            uint128((treasury.usdaGainedFromLiquidation() * RATE_PRECISION) / abond.totalSupply());
@>>     uint256 usdaToTransfer = (usdaToAbondRatioLiq * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION;
        treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false);
```
Only `usdaToAbondRatio` is updated during the liquidation process in `borrowLiquidation.sol` - [reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L210) . The `usdaToAbondRatioLiq` is left out and is only updated in the redeem function itself. This results in discrepancies.

### Impact

- Incorrect transfer amounts.
- Potential loss of funds.
