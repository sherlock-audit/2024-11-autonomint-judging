# `withdraw` Function And `redeemUSDT` Function of `CDs` Contract Always Reverts

### Summary

When the `withdraw` function of the `CDs` contract is called, the `Treasury` contract approves the `CDs` contract instead of `msg.sender`. Consequently, the `Treasury` contract attempts to send ETH/tokens to `msg.sender`, resulting in a transaction revert.

### Root Cause

When a user attempts to withdraw from `CDs`, the `withdrawUser` function of the `CDSLib` library is invoked.

As mentioned in the summary, the `Treasury` contract approves the `CDs` contract instead of `msg.sender`, which leads to a revert when the `Treasury` contract tries to send ETH/tokens to `msg.sender`.

### PoC

In the `Treasury` contract, the following line is executed because the token is `USDa`:
```solidity
        state = usda.contractApprove(spender, amount);
```
This calls the `contractApprove` function of the `USDa` contract:
```solidity
        function contractApprove(
            address spender,
            uint256 value
        ) public onlyTreasury returns (bool) {
            return _contractApprove(msg.sender, spender, value);
        }
```
Here, `spender` is the address of the `CDs` contract, and `msg.sender` is the address of the `Treasury` contract.

The internal `_contractApprove` function is defined as follows:
```solidity
        function _contractApprove(
            address owner,
            address spender,
            uint256 value
        ) internal returns (bool) {
            if (owner == address(0)) revert ERC20InvalidApprover(address(0));
            if (spender == address(0)) revert ERC20InvalidSpender(address(0));
            contractAllowances[owner][spender] = value;
            emit Approval(owner, spender, value);
            return true;
        }
```
In this context, `owner` is the address of the `Treasury` contract, and `spender` is the address of the `CDs` contract.

As indicated, `contractAllowances[owner][spender]` represents the allowance from the `Treasury` contract to the `CDs` contract. However, the `USDa` tokens are being sent from the `Treasury` contract to `msg.sender`, who called the `withdraw` function of the `CDs` contract:


### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the approval should be modified as follows:

```solidity
        interfaces.treasury.approveTokens(
            IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa,
-           address(interfaces.cds),
            params.usdaToTransfer
        );
```

```solidity
        interfaces.treasury.approveTokens(
            IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa,
-           msg.sender,
            params.usdaToTransfer
        );
```
