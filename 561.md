# the collateral strike price is not checked

### Summary

strikePrice is not check in `CDSLib.sol`. User can pass lower `strikePrice` is to `deposit` function of `CDSLib.sol`. As a result, users can pay less fee (1/400) than expected

### Root Cause

the option fee is calculated from `params.volatility`, `params.strikePercent` etc. in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L674-L679

But the `strikePrice` is also a param controllable by the user and not checked.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L754

So user can pass `params.strikePercent` to `StrikePrice.TWENTY_FIVE` to pay lowest fee.
but pass a lower `strikePercent` (101% current price of ETH for example) which should not allowed by the protocol.
