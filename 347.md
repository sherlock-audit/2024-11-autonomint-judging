# if omniChainData.downsideProtected is bigger than totalCdsDepositedAmount(for the interaction chain), then calling the function deposit(cdslib.sol)/ function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(cdslib.sol) will revert.

### Summary

whenever the withdraw function(borrowlib.sol) is called in any chain, omniChainData.downsideProtected is increased/updated. This omniChainData.downsideProtected is collected from all chains. So omniChainData.downsideProtected may become bigger than one chain’s  totalCdsDepositedAmount . if omniChainData.downsideProtected is bigger than one chain’s  totalCdsDepositedAmount and other chain’s function deposit(cdslib.sol)/ function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(cdslib.sol) is not still called, then calling this chain’s function deposit(cdslib.sol)/ function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(cdslib.sol) may revert.


### Root Cause

omniChainData.downsideProtected may become bigger than one chain’s  totalCdsDepositedAmount.

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, currently totalCdsDepositedAmount = 1000 in this chain(chain1/market1) and omniChainData.downsideProtected = 1000(which are updated/increased from other chains/markets with the function withdraw[borrowingLib.sol] but function deposit[cdsLib.sol] and  function withdrawUser are still not called in other chains/markets, so omniChainData.downsideProtected is still 1000)

2. now the function deposit(cdslib.sol) in this chain(chain1/market1) is called by a user to deposit 100. Now 1000 omniChainData.downsideProtected amount is deducted from  totalCdsDepositedAmount  in this chain(chain1/market1). Now   totalCdsDepositedAmount in this chain1/market1 = 1000-1000+100 = 100(as 100 is added from the depositor ).

3. now a depositor(the depositor is not opted for liquidation) of this chain1/market1 call withdraw to withdraw his 200 amounts, see the    function withdrawUser which calls  function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq where totalCdsDepositedAmount  in this chain(chain1/market1) is 100 but the depositor’s  cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = 200, so the update of totalCdsDepositedAmount i.e  totalCdsDepositedAmount -= params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount; i.e 100-200 will create underflow and the function will revert.

4. if omniChainData.downsideProtected is bigger than totalCdsDepositedAmount(chain1/market1), then calling the function deposit(cdslib.sol) will revert. Let's see how?  If omniChainData.downsideProtected = 1100 and totalCdsDepositedAmount(chain1/market1) = 900, now see function deposit(cds.sol) where users calls 100 to deposit, so totalCdsDepositedAmount(chain1/market1) is increased to 1000 and then 1100  omniChainData.downsideProtected will be deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmount(1000) i.e _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount i.e 1000-1100 which will create underflow which will lead to revert of the function.

### Impact

 if omniChainData.downsideProtected is bigger than totalCdsDepositedAmount(for the interaction chain), then calling the function deposit(cdslib.sol)/ function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(cdslib.sol) will revert. There may remain less usda amounts for cds depositors(who have not opted for liquidation) in a chain.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

socialise  omniChainData.downsideProtected equally/properly for every chain.
