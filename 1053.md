# Logic Error in Options Renewal Validation Enables Unauthorized Protection Benefits

### Summary

A critical logic flaw has been identified in the `borrowing::renewOptions` functionality. While the system is designed to allow position renewal within a 15-30 day window from the last renewal timestamp, a faulty implementation of the validation check permits users to renew their options at any time. This oversight enables borrowers to maintain downside protection benefits even after the intended maturity period.


### Root Cause

In [BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L446C1-L451C57) this checks the user if he is renewing his options position in btw 15 to 30 days of last `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` but the ISSUE here is that this check will never ever revert due to wrong implementation, and therefore the borrower will be able to renew his option anytime before the withdraw (even after the 30 days maturity as has passed) and will enjoy the benefit of downside protection in withdraw. Which is an ISSUE, this should not happen.

The root cause of this vulnerability is the incorrect logical operator used in the time check condition. The current implementation uses && (AND) instead of || (OR), which makes the condition always false and never let it revert.

```solidity
            if (
                block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days
                    && block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```

### Impact

The vulnerability creates a financial risk for the protocol as borrowers can exploit the faulty validation to obtain unauthorized downside protection. This results in reduced debt repayments through the formula `depositDetail.totalDebtAmountPaid = borrowerDebt - downsideProtected`, directly impacting protocol revenues.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The time window validation needs to be corrected by replacing the logical AND operator with OR:

```diff
if (
    block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days
-        && block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
+        || block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```

This modification ensures options can only be renewed within the intended 15-30 day window, preventing exploitation of the downside protection mechanism.
