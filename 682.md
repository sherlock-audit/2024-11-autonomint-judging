# Potential Underflow in CDS Withdrawal Calculation Due to Strike Price Gain

### Summary

There is a potential issue in the collateral calculation process during the withdrawal phase, specifically in the calculation of `collateralToReturn`. The formula used to calculate `collateralToReturn` adds the strike price gain to the deposited amount, which can lead to a situation where `collateralToReturn` exceeds the original deposited amount. This, in turn, causes an underflow when calculating `collateralRemainingInWithdraw`.

### Root Cause

1. **Calculation of `collateralToReturn`**: The current logic adds the strike price gain (calculated by `params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains`) to the `depositedAmountvalue`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L482-L487
This can cause collateralToReturn to exceed depositedAmountInETH, depending on the value returned by calculateStrikePriceGains.

2. Subtraction in `collateralRemainingInWithdraw`: When calculating `collateralRemainingInWithdraw`, the code performs the following operation:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L489
If `collateralToReturn` exceeds `depositedAmountInETH`, this leads to an underflow, causing the transaction to revert. Hence, withdrawal became an issue.

### Attack Path

Example Scenario
Assumptions:
depositedAmountInETH = 10 ETH
ethPriceAtDeposit = 2000 USD
current ethPrice = 2500 USD
strikePrice = 15000 USD

Step-by-Step Calculation:
depositedAmountvalue Calculation:
```solidity
depositedAmountvalue = (10 * 2000) / 2500 = 8 ETH
```

calculateStrikePriceGains Calculation:
```solidity
currentEthValue = 10 * 2500 = 25000 USD
ethToReturn = (25000 - 15000) / 2500 = 4 ETH
```

collateralToReturn Calculation:
```solidity
collateralToReturn = 8 + 4 = 12 ETH
```

Underflow Scenario: Now, when attempting to calculate collateralRemainingInWithdraw:
```solidity
collateralRemainingInWithdraw = 10 - 12 // Results in underflow
```
This will cause an underflow error, as Solidity will attempt to subtract a larger number from a smaller one.

### Impact

**Transaction Reversion**: When the subtraction results in an underflow, the transaction will revert, halting the withdrawal process. This prevents the user from completing the withdrawal.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent the underflow, the code should check that collateralToReturn does not exceed depositedAmountInETH. If it does, the collateralToReturn should be limited to depositedAmountInETH. This will avoid the subtraction that results in an underflow.
