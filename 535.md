# One part of protocol profit will be locked in the treasury

### Summary

The profit from `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` will be locked in the treasury. We don't have any methods to withdraw these profits.

### Root Cause

When cds owners withdraw their positions, we will calculate the [cds owner's profit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L801-L803) and split 10% profit as the protocol profit. We will update the protocol profit via `updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw`.

`usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` variable stores the 10% deducted usda from cds users during withdraw as the protocol profit. The problem is that in Treasury contract, we don't have any methods to withdraw this part of protocol profit.

```solidity
    function withdrawUser(
        CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees,
        mapping(uint128 liquidationIndex => CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo)
            storage omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
                interfaces.treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(returnAmountWithGains - params.usdaToTransfer);
                // update liquidatedCollateralCollectedFromCdsWithdraw, not any use here.
                interfaces.treasury.updateLiquidatedETHCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(params.ethAmount);
}

    function updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
        usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw += amount;
    }
```
