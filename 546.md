# Incorrect Ether Recipient in Liquidation

### Summary

When liquidating a position using `liquidationType1` and the `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` is zero, the remaining Ether (intended for LayerZero transaction fees) is incorrectly sent to the *user* instead of the *admin* who initiated the liquidation.


### Root Cause


When admin liquidated a position it must send ETH/native tokens to covert the lz tx fees if the liqudiation is the `liquidationType1` it contains a conditional refund mechanism. When `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` is zero, the code intends to refund the unused ETH/native tokens. However, the recipient is specified as `user` instead of `msg.sender` (the admin):

```solidity
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
    (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

* A borrow position exists that is eligible for liquidation (below downside protection).
* The `liquidationType` is set to `ONE`.
* The `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` calculated within the `liquidationType1` function is zero.

### External pre-conditions

* The admin initiates the `liquidate` function in the borrowing contract, providing the necessary Ether to cover potential LayerZero fees.


### Attack Path

1. An attacker creates a borrow position that falls below the downside protection threshold.
2. The attacker ensures that the CDS on the current chain has enough USDa to cover the liquidation entirely, resulting in `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` being zero.
3. The admin initiates the liquidation, sending Ether to cover LayerZero fees.
4. Instead of the admin receiving the unused Ether back, the attacker (borrower) receives the Ether, effectively gaining an unintended profit.

### Impact

Loss of funds for the admin. This allows the user to profit from their own liquidation.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Change the recipient of the Ether refund from `user` to `msg.sender` (the admin) in the `liquidationType1` function:

```solidity
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
    (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: msg.value}(""); // Corrected recipient
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```
