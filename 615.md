# No Minimum Deposit Leads to Creation of Unliquidatable Borrow Positions

### Summary

The protocol allows users to make very small deposits and mint an equivalent amount of ``USDA`` tokens, which leads to the creation of numerous tiny borrow positions. This is due to the absence of a minimum deposit requirement in the ``depositTokens`` function, allowing an attacker to exploit this loophole and create positions that are difficult or expensive to liquidate.

### Root Cause

In the ``borrowing.sol::depositTokens`` function, there is no validation or enforcement of a minimum deposit amount. As a result, an attacker or group of attackers can deposit extremely small amounts of assets, which are then converted into ``USDA`` tokens. These positions are then minted for the user, and since there is no minimum limit for either deposits or the amount of ``USDA`` tokens minted, it becomes possible to create many tiny positions.
These small positions become problematic when it comes to liquidation. The cost of liquidating such positions can far exceed the value of the assets involved, creating a situation where the protocol admin must choose between incurring gas fees to liquidate them or allowing bad debt to accumulate, which could eventually lead to protocol insolvency and loss of funds for all users.

### Attack Path

Attackers can exploit the absence of a minimum deposit amount to create many small positions, as described in the following code snippet:

These positions become unliquidatable, resulting in a situation where the protocol faces a choice between incurring high liquidation costs or accumulating bad debt.

### Impact

- **Insolvency Risk**: Accumulation of small, unliquidatable positions can lead to bad debt, putting the protocol's financial stability at risk.
- **Increased Gas Costs**: Liquidating these positions becomes impractical due to high gas fees, potentially leading to loss of funds.
- **Protocol Exploitation**: Attackers can abuse this flaw to create a large number of small positions, destabilizing the system and causing long-term harm to the protocolâ€™s users.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement a minimum deposit amount in the `depositTokens` function to prevent users from making negligible deposits.
Similarly, enforce a minimum amount of `USDA` tokens that can be minted per deposit, ensuring that only meaningful positions are created.
