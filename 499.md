# Resetting `lastEventTime` before calling `calculateCumulativeRate()` is problematic

### Summary

`calculateCumulativeRate()` is used to calculate the cumulative rate of the protocol, which is a value used for calculating the [interest rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L77) when repaying.

Given that in `borrowing::_withdraw()` it is being updated just before calling the `calculateCumulativeRate()`, it will actually calculate it in such a way that no time (0 seconds) has passed, due to [lastEventTime being equal to the block.timestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L243) as we've updated `lastEventTime` just before invoking `calculateCumulativeRate()`

### Root Cause

The root cause is plain and simple - updating the `lastEventTime` before calling `calculateCumulativeRate()` is wrong and the `lastEventTime` should be updated **after calling calculateCumulativeRate()**, so that the `calculateCumulativeRate()` is calculating a correct value.

This will happen on every single call to `borrowing::withdraw()` and calculate every single time a smaller cumulative rate, thus incurring losses for the protocol as it collects less from interest rate (cumulative value is used to calculate the interest rate during repayment).

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `borrowing::withdraw()` and the `calculateCumulativeRate()` is smaller than it should have been.

### Impact

Protocol is the one who is receiving interest rate from the interest being paid by borrowers, thus the protocol is the one who will incur losses and collect much less interest rate than it should have and this will compound overtime.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `lastEventTime` after calling `calculateCumulativeRate()`
