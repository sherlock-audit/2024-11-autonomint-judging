# `borrowing.renewOptions()`'s promised 30 days 80% downside protection is not enforced in the `borrowing.liquidate()` or anywhere in the `borrowing.sol`

### Summary

The 80% downside protection mechanism, which promises 30-day protection for borrowers through renewOptions() and new deposits, is completely non-functional at the contract level due to missing implementation checks in `borrowing:liquidate()`. This exposes borrowers to immediate liquidation risk despite documentation and code comments suggesting otherwise.

### Root Cause

In [`borrowing.sol:363`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L363-L409), there are no checks implemented to verify:

1. If a position has active downside protection
2. If a position is within its initial 30-day protection period
3. If renewOptions() has been called to extend protection

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User has an active borrow position
2. User has called renewOptions() expecting 30-day protection
3. ETH price movement makes position eligible for liquidation

### Attack Path

1. User deposits and borrows, expecting 30-day protection
2. Price moves unfavorably
3. Position can be immediately liquidated despite:
  - Being within "protected" period
  - Having paid for renewOptions()
  - Documentation promising protection

### Impact

- Borrowers have no actual downside protection
- renewOptions() fees are collected without providing promised protection
- New deposits can be immediately liquidated
- Contradicts core protocol promises and documentation
- May lead to unexpected losses for users relying on protection

### PoC

See attack path

### Mitigation

1. Implement protection period checks in borrowLiquidation.sol:

```solidity
function liquidate(address borrower) external {
    Position memory position = positions[borrower];
    
    // Check protection period
    if (block.timestamp < position.lastRenewal + 30 days) {
        revert PositionProtected();
    }
    
    // Check initial deposit protection
    if (block.timestamp < position.depositTime + 30 days) {
        revert InitialProtectionActive();
    }
    
    // Proceed with liquidation
    _liquidate(borrower);
}
```
