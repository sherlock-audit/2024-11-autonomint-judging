# Insufficient validation of Chainlink data feeds


## Vulnerability Details
In the `MasterPriceOracle` contract, the protocol uses a ChainLink aggregator to fetch the `latestRoundData()`,
```javascript
// Get the eth price 
(, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
```
 however, these calls to `oracle::latestRoundData` lack the necessary validation for Chainlink data feeds to ensure that the protocol does not ingest stale or incorrect pricing data that could indicate a faulty feed.


## Impact
This discrepancy could have the protocol produce incorrect values for fetched asset prices

## Tool Used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider adding missing checks for stale data:
```javascript
-       (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
+        (uint80 RoundID, int256 Answer,, uint256 Timestamp, uint80 AnsweredInRound) =
+            oracle.latestRoundData();
+        require(AnsweredInRound >= RoundID, "Stale price!");
+        require(Timestamp != 0, "Round not complete!");
+        require(block.timestamp - Timestamp <= VALID_TIME_PERIOD);
```
