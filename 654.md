# Mismanagement of `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` During Liquidation

### Summary

During liquidation, the expected behavior is to update the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable by calling `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation`. However, this call is replaced with `treasury.updateAbondUSDaPool(returnToAbond, true)`. As a result, the USDA gained from liquidation is incorrectly added to the `abondUSDaPool` instead of `usdaGainedFromLiquidation`. This mismanagement leads to discrepancies in the `redeemYields` function, where calculations dependent on `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` are inaccurate.

### Root Cause

1. **Incorrect Function Call During Liquidation:**
Instead of updating `usdaGainedFromLiquidation`, the USDA funds from liquidation are added to the `abondUSDaPool`.

2. **Dependency in redeemYields Function:**
The `redeemYields` function calculates `usdaToAbondRatioLiq` based on `usdaGainedFromLiquidation`. Since this value is not updated correctly, the function fails to accurately compute the USDA to be transferred to users.
