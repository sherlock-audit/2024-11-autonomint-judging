# Liquidating a user is likely to revert due to an underflow

### Summary

When a user gets liquidated through `liquidationType1` the yields accrued from the deposited amount are calculated. The issue is that the calculations are highly likely to caus an underflow, preventing the user from being liquidated.


### Root Cause

In borrowLiquidation.liquidationType1 the following calculation is performed:

```solidity
        uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

This is problematic as the if the `exchangeRate` has gone since the time of the deposit `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)` will be higher than `depositDetail.depositedAmount`, causing an underflow.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user gets liquidated through `liquidationType1`.
2. Since the time of the deposit the asset's ETH `exchangeRate` has decreased in value.
3. As a result, there will be no yield, but instead the liquidation will revert due to an underflow of the `yields` variable.

### Impact

Liquidations may fail to execute.

### Mitigation

Make sure that the exchange rate has not decreased in value, before calculating `yields`.
