# Share Price Manipulation in Initial Deposits

### Summary

The lack of minimum deposit validation and share price bounds in BorrowLib.sol will cause significant loss of funds for depositors as an attacker will frontrun deposits with tiny amounts to manipulate the share price ratio.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib.sol` the following functions lack proper share price protection:

```solidity
// Vulnerable function that calculates normalized amount without minimum checks
function calculateNormAmount(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 cumulativeRate
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return (amount * RATE_PRECISION) / cumulativeRate;
}

// Vulnerable function that calculates debt amount without bounds
function calculateDebtAmount(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 cumulativeRate
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return (amount * cumulativeRate) / RATE_PRECISION;
}

// Missing minimum deposit validation in deposit handling
function deposit(
    uint256 depositingAmount,
    // other params...
) public returns (uint256) {
    // Only checks for non-zero, but no minimum amount
    if (params.depositingAmount == 0) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
    
    // Calculate normalized amount without price bounds check
    uint256 normalizedAmount = calculateNormAmount(tokensToMint, libParams.lastCumulativeRate);
    // ...
}
```

The key issues are:
1. No minimum deposit amount enforced beyond zero check
2. No share price bounds validation
3. Missing slippage protection
4. No protection against price manipulation through donations
5. Lack of cooldown period for large deposits

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Total supply needs to be 0 (first deposit)
2. Protocol needs to have no minimum deposit amount enforced
3. Share price calculation needs to use fixed point math without proper bounds checking

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors mempool for large deposit transactions
2. When a large deposit is detected, attacker frontruns with a tiny deposit (e.g. 1 wei)
3. This tiny deposit receives 1 share, setting an artificial share price
4. The victim's large deposit transaction executes next, but receives virtually no shares due to the inflated share price
5. Attacker can then withdraw their single share worth the entire deposited amount

### Impact

The depositors suffer complete loss of their deposited funds. The attacker gains nearly 100% of victim deposits by manipulating the initial share price ratio.

### PoC

Scenario:
1. Alice wants to deposit 100 ETH
2. Bob (attacker) sees Alice's transaction in mempool
3. Bob frontruns with 1 wei deposit, receives 1 share
4. Alice's 100 ETH deposit executes but receives 0 shares due to rounding
5. Bob withdraws 1 share and receives ~100 ETH
6. Alice has lost her entire 100 ETH deposit

### Mitigation

Implement minimum deposit amount for initial deposits
