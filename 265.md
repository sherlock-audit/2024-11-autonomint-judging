# The `borrowing.sol#withDraw` may be DOSed because of less hardcoded value than tested.

### Summary

Less hardcoded gas amount than tested will cause DOS.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L676

### Root Cause

- In borrowing.sol:676, less hardcoded value than tested is passed.
```solidity
    // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
    bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(350000, 0);
```
As we can see from doc and other parts of protocol, 350000 is less than tested.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User may suffer from DOS because of less hardcoded gas amount when assigning options.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`borrowing.sol:676` has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
--  bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(350000, 0);
++  bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);
```
