# ETH sent to cover Layer Zero execution fees is not refunded

### Summary

All the functions that modifies the state of the `omniChainData` through `GlobalVariables` need some ETH to cover Layer Zero execution fees. However, while `GlobalVariables::send` receives the `fee.nativeFee` value calculated in the `GlobalVariables::quote` function, and as that value is calculated during the transaction, the user is likely to send an excess so transaction does not revert due to lack of gas to pay LZ execution. That excess is never refunded to the `msg.sender`.

### Root Cause

This issue occurs throughout the project in functions that interact with Layer Zero to update values in the other chain. 
A representative example of one of these functions is `Borrowing::depositTokens`. 
In the mentioned function, the user could deposit native ETH or one of the allowed `ERC20` (`weETH`, `wrsETH`). 

The most complex scenario to this is when user deposits native ETH because the `msg.value` needs to be equal or grater than `depositParams.depositingAmount + fee.nativeFee`. As `fee.nativeFee` cannot be calculated before sending the ETH in the call of the function, an excess is likely to be sent so the transaction does not revert.

`Borrowing::depositTokens`, receives `msg.value >= depositParams.depositingAmount + fee.nativeFee`, and spends it in the following pieces of code:
1) Sending the `depositParams.depositingAmount` to the `Treasury`:
[BorrowLib#L692-L700](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L692-L700)
```solidity
        ITreasury.DepositResult memory depositResult = interfaces.treasury.deposit{
            value: params.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? params.depositingAmount : 0
        }(
            msg.sender,
            libParams.ethPrice,
            uint64(block.timestamp),
            params.assetName,
            params.depositingAmount
        );
```
2) Sending `fee.nativeFee` in `GlobalVariables::send`:
[borrowing.sol#L260-L268](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L260-L268)
```solidity
        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositParam.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
```

The excess., which is needed to be sent, is never refunded to the sender. Meaning that `msg.value - depositParam.depositingAmount - fee.nativeFee` is the not refunded amount.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- A normal user deposits tokens in `Borrowing` in the normal flow.

### Impact

Loss of `msg.value - depositParam.depositingAmount - fee.nativeFee` ETH amount for the user.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Refund the excess funds sent to the `msg.sender` at the end of the function call, or add that excess to the depositing amount to avoid an external call inside the transaction.
