# `BorrowLiquidation::liquidationType1` will send 10% of protected amount to ABOND USDA pool even if liquidated collateral is not ETH.

### Summary

The `BorrowLiquidation::liquidationType1` function in the Borrowing contract sends 10% of the protected amount to the ABOND USDA pool even when the liquidated collateral is not ETH, contradicting the documented behavior.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLiquidation`, the `liquidationType1` function calls `treasury.updateAbondUSDaPool(returnToAbond, true)` to send 10% of the protected amount to the ABOND USDA pool. This action is performed regardless of the type of collateral being liquidated, contradicting the documentation which states this should only happen when the collateral is ETH.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.  liquidation must be of Type  1.
2.  Collateral `depositDetail.assetName` needs to be other than `ETH`.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The borrowing contract calls `liquidateBorrowPosition` to liquidate a borrower's position where the collateral is not ETH.
2. `liquidationType1` is called to handle the liquidation.
3. Regardless of the collateral type, 10% of the protected amount is incorrectly sent to the ABOND USDA pool despite the collateral not being ETH.

### Impact

The ABOND USDA pool receives funds from liquidations where the collateral is not ETH, which is not the intended behavior according to the documentation. This could lead to an imbalance in the pool and potentially affect its functionality.

### PoC

In the function, [BorrowLiquidation::liquidationType1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L208-L210):

```solidity
function liquidationType1(
    address user,
    uint64 index,
    uint64 currentEthPrice,
    uint256 lastCumulativeRate
) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
      ...
      // 20% to abond usda pool
      uint128 returnToAbond = BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, returnToTreasury);
      treasury.updateAbondUSDaPool(returnToAbond, true);

     ...
}
```

The function does record part of the deposited amount with `updateAbondUSDaPool` toward the ABOND pool regardless of the collateral type being used, even though in the [docs](https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/blockchain-docs/core-contracts/borrowliquidation#liquidationtype1) it is stated "10% of protected amount is going to ABOND USDa pool if the liquidated collateral is ETH".

### Mitigation

Update the `liquidationType1` function to ensure that 10% of the protected amount is sent to the ABOND USDA pool only when the liquidated collateral is ETH. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check the `depositDetail.assetName` before calling `treasury.updateAbondUSDaPool`.

```solidity
uint128 returnToAbond;
if (depositDetail.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
   returnToAbond = BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, returnToTreasury);
    treasury.updateAbondUSDaPool(returnToAbond, true);
}
```
