# borrowing::renewOptions - `calculateCumulativeRate` isn't called in `renewOptions`

### Summary

`calculateCumulativeRate` is supposed to update `lastCumulativeRate` based on several factors like number of borrowers, rater per sec, last event time and the last cumulative rate. It's very important that the function is called in the correct places otherwise issues can occur.

It should be called along every time an "event" happens (one of the external facing functions is called). In `renewOptions` this isn't the case, the function isn't called anywhere, so this "event" isn't tracked so to say and the `lastCumulativeRate` and the `lastEventTime` aren't updated.

```jsx
function renewOptions(uint64 index) external payable {
        if (
            !BorrowLib.renewOptions(
                Interfaces(
                    treasury,
                    globalVariables,
                    usda,
                    abond,
                    cds,
                    options
                ),
                index
            )
        ) revert Borrow_RenewFailed();

        // Get the deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
        treasury.updateDepositDetails(msg.sender, index, depositDetail);

        // define options for lz send transaction with 400000 gas(found by testing)
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);

        // calculting fee for lz send transaction
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositDetail.assetName,
            _options,
            false
        );

        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositDetail.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );

        emit Renewed(msg.sender, index, block.timestamp);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`calculateCumulativeRate` isn't called in `renewOptions`, so this "event" isn't tracked so to say and the `lastCumulativeRate` and the `lastEventTime` aren't updated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call `calculateCumulativeRate` and update `lastEventTime`
