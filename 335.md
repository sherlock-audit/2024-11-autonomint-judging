# Protocol will get less  interest from borrowers as  CumulativeRate is updated after borrower withdrawal.

### Summary

when the  function _withdraw(borrowing.sol) is called, calculateCumulativeRate function is called to update  CumulativeRate but calculateCumulativeRate function is called at the end of the function _withdraw. As a result users will pay less interest because interest is calculated  based on previous  CumulativeRate not based on updated CumulativeRate.



### Root Cause

CumulativeRate is updated after user withdrawal in the  function _withdraw(borrowing.sol). 


### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Letâ€™s assume, Alice borrows some usda and during borrowing time CumulativeRate is 0.1(this is just for example).

2. after some time, alice calls the withdraw function to withdraw her collateral by repaying usda and currently CumulativeRate is 0.2(just for example) which is not updated based on present time but if currently calculateCumulativeRate is called, current CumulativeRate will be updated to 0.3(just for example) based on present time.

3. so alice will pay interest based on deposit time  CumulativeRate i.e 0.1 and unupdated CumulativeRate i.e 0.2 . so alice will not pay interest based on  deposit time  CumulativeRate i.e 0.1 and current updated CumulativeRate i.e 0.3 because CumulativeRate is updated after user withdrawal in the  function _withdraw(borrowing.sol). So CumulativeRate should be updated before user withdrawal in the function _withdraw.

4. as a result, users will pay less interest which is a loss for the protocol.

### Impact

users will pay less interest which is a loss for the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

CumulativeRate should be updated before user withdrawal(at the beginning of the function _withdraw) in the function _withdraw.
