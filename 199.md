# Lack of Authorization Check in the updateDownsideProtected Function

### Summary

The updateDownsideProtected function enables a malicious actor to set the downsideProtected value to an excessively high amount. During deposit and withdraw operations, the _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount function is invoked. If the downsideProtected value exceeds the totalCdsDepositedAmount, an overflow error occurs, causing both deposit and withdraw functions to fail.

### Root Cause

The updateDownsideProtected function enables a malicious actor to set the downsideProtected value to an excessively high amount. During deposit and withdraw operations, the _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount function is invoked. If the downsideProtected value exceeds the totalCdsDepositedAmount, an overflow error occurs, causing both deposit and withdraw functions to fail.

        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
            totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

A malicious user calls the updateDownsideProtected function and sets the downsideProtected value to an extremely high value, larger than totalCdsDepositedAmount.
When a legitimate user attempts to perform a deposit or withdraw, the _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount function is triggered.
Due to the high downsideProtected value, an overflow occurs during calculations, causing the transaction to revert.
This effectively blocks all deposit and withdraw operations for all users, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the protocol.


### Impact

deposit and withdrawal transactions become unavailable, users cannot access their funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add Authorization Check: Restrict the updateDownsideProtected function to be called only by authorized persons or contracts.
