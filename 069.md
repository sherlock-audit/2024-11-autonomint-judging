# Cross-chain wrsETH amount is wrapped before the treasury have received it, which could revert the whole transaction

### Summary
When performing a dCDS withdrawal, if the user has opted in for liquidations, there are cases where we need to retrieve collateral (ETH/rsETH or other) from another chain. However, the protocol attempts to wrap the `wrsETH` before it has been received, causing the transaction to revert.

### Root Cause
In the case of liquidation opt-in for a dCDS depositor, we may need to retrieve ETH from another chain. This situation occurs when liquidations happen on a different chain, and the collateral retrieved from them is stored there.

In `CDSLib.sol`, the liquidation calculation logic is implemented [here - CDSLib.sol#L624-L777](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L624-L777).

The issue arises because the protocol attempts to wrap the funds in the treasury before they have been received, leading to a transaction revert.

                            // Call getLzFunctionToDo in cds library to get, which action needs to do in dst chain
                            getLzFunctionToDo(params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain, collateralToGetFromOtherChain)
                        ),
                        IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(
                            address(interfaces.treasury), params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain
                        ),
                        IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(
                         address(interfaces.treasury)
                            ethAmountFromOtherChain,
                            weETHAmountFromOtherChain,
                            rsETHAmountFromOtherChain
                        ),
                        IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.CDS_WITHDRAW,
                        msg.sender
                    );
                    if (rsETHAmountFromOtherChain > 0) {
                        //@audit-issue this is incorrect. Its not yet received, and we wrap it here?
@>>                    interfaces.treasury.wrapRsETH(rsETHAmountFromOtherChain);
                    }
```
LayerZero needs technical time to process the transaction, send it to the other chain, and wait for the other chain to respond and send the requesting chain the collateral.

### Internal Preconditions
Liquidations for `rsETH` have occurred on the other chain, and there are not enough `rsETH` resources on the current chain to cover the share of `rsETH` owed to the dCDS user depositor.

### Attack Path
A normal dCDS depositor attempts to withdraw their position, which is opted-in for liquidations.

### Impact
The transaction reverts, resulting in the inability to withdraw funds from the dCDS.

### Mitigation
Avoid wrapping the `rsETH` before receiving it.
