# `OwnableUpgradeable` is not implemented in `USDa`

### Summary

`OwnableUpgradeable` is not implemented which will cause functions with `onlyOwner` modifier revert.

### Root Cause

`OwnableUpgradeable` is imported but not implemented in `USDa`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

In `USDa` contract, `OwnableUpgradeable` from openzeppelin is imported and `__Ownable_init` is called in `initialize` function to initialize owner.

```solidity

  function initialize(
        address _lzEndpoint,
        address _delegate
    ) public initializer {
      ---
      
      // Initialize the owner of the contract
@->   __Ownable_init(msg.sender);

      ---
    }

```
[Link to Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/USDa.sol#L49)

But `USDa` is not inheriting from `OwnableUpgradable` which means `onlyOwner` functions which includes:

  * _authorizeUpgrade 
  * setDstEid
  * pause
  * unpause
  * setBorrowingContract
  * setBorrowLiqContract
  * setCdsContract
  * setTreasuryContract

will be DoSed.

### Impact

Owner is not initialized correctly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Inherit `OwnableUpgradable` in `USDa` Contract.

    contract USDaStablecoin is
