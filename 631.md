# Incorrect check in `BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay` will never revert the `renewOptions` flow for borrowers, causing a negative impact on the protocol.

### Summary

The concept behind function `borrowing::renewOptions` is to renew the position by 30 days by paying USDa, and by doing that user will keep getting downside protection for more 30 days. This renewal must be only allowed in a range of 15 to 30 days of last `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` of the borrower, but this check is been incorrectly implemented in this function flow, allowing borrowers to renew their options at any time, even after the 30-day maturity period, and letting them enjoy their downside protection at the time of `borrowing::withDraw`.


### Root Cause

In [BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L446C1-L451C57) this checks the user if he is renewing his options position in btw 15 to 30 days of last `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` but the ISSUE here is that this check will never ever revert due to wrong implementation, and therefore the borrower will be able to renew his option anytime before the withdraw (even after the 30 days maturity as has passed) and will enjoy the benefit of downside protection in withdraw. Which is an ISSUE, this should not happen.

The root cause of this vulnerability is the incorrect logical operator used in the time check condition. The current implementation uses && (AND) instead of || (OR), which makes the condition always false and never let it revert.


```solidity
            if (
                block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days
                    && block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- borrower took a loan (borrowing::deposit).
- more than 30 days passed and borrower did not renew his option.
- ex. 40 days past and now borrowers want to repay the loan(borrowing::withDraw), but according to logic of withDraw function,
downside protection only gets to the users whose options are under maturity.
- so the borrower will first renew his option (after 40 days), and due to the ISSUE we discussed this renewal should not have happened after 40 days, and user should not be getting the benefit of downside protection at the time of withdraw, but to wrong implementation of that check, this will pass.
- Borrower will now withdraw, by enjoying the un-intended downside protection at the time of withdrawal by paying less debt. 

### Impact

As shown in the attack path, we can clearly see Borrower is enjoying the un-intended downside protection while withdrawing. This means here borrower will pay less total Debt Amount to the protocol `depositDetail.totalDebtAmountPaid = borrowerDebt - downsideProtected;` , ultimately making a loss of funds to of protocol. (There's one more vul related to this in withdraw func, but that is been written in a different report, so please don't match each other) 

Likelihood - High (this check will fail everytime, letting renew options even after 30 days)
Impact - High (loss of protocol funds)
- Therefore Severity = High


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


ImplemHere the renew option should be only possible, in between 15 to 30 days of `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` , by appluing correct check.
recommendation ->

```diff
if (
    block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days
-        && block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
+        || block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
