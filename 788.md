# ChainLink Oracle not checking for stale prices with `updatedAt` field

## Summary

The updatedAt timestamp in the price feed response is not checked. So outdated prices may be used.

[Relevant Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83)

## Vulnerability Details

Oracle data feeds can return stale pricing data for a variety of reasons. If the returned pricing data is stale, this code will execute with prices that don’t reflect the current pricing.

## Impact

Using stale priceFeed could cause the following problems:

From the attacker's perspective, they could exploit this to borrow stablecoins with less collateral value cost.

From the perspective of protocol design, using outdated oracle price data introduces a range of issues. Since the protocol’s key metric calculations—such as calculateRatio, calculateDownsideProtected, and calculateEthPriceRatio—require up-to-date and low-latency ethPrice records, stale price data leads to inaccuracies in these calculations. This can cause the protocol to deviate from its intended operation.

Moreover, if the stale oracle data result in the actual price (actualPrice) falling below the reported price (feedPrice), it could break the invariant:

> New Borrows cannot mint new stablecoin if cds/borrow ratio is below 0.2 and cds users cannot withdraw. This might have a user experience issue.

Such issues could negatively impact user experience and the protocol’s reliability.

## Recommended mitigation

Smart contracts should always check the updatedAt parameter returned from latestRoundData() and compare it to a staleness threshold.
The staleness threshold should correspond to the heartbeat of the oracle’s price feed.
You can reference [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=optimism&page=1) for the correspond answer.For L2 like Optimism network, make sure to select the right reference on that page before reading the data columns.

```typescript
(, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();

if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60 /* 1 hour */) {
   revert("stale price feed");
}
```
