# `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` doesn't encode the data with `struct OAppData`

### Summary

In `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` the data that is being encoded is not wrapped in `struct OAppData`, which is wrong because `_lzSend()` is going to take the data as is and when trying to decode it, we are going to error due to an incorrect type decoding.

### Root Cause

The root cause is not wrapping the [payload](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L224-L237) in `GlobalVariables::oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` with an `OAppData` as in the other functions that wrap the payload before calling `_lzSend()`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. During liquidation, we are calling `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` to get the remaining `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` from the other chains
2. The call will not be successful due to not wrapping the payload in `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` with a `struct OAppData`

### Impact

This will make all the functions that invoke it uncallable such as `liquidate()` via the `liquidationType1()`, as well `borrowing::_withdraw()` thus making it impossible to withdraw collateral from borrowers and liquidate bad debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Wrap the payload in the `OAppData` and ensure consistency in the payload type.
