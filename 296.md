# Denial of Service on MultiSign::executeSetterFunction

### Summary

The `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction` function can be called by anyone. When this function is executed, the `approvedToUpdate[_function][owner]` mapping is reset to `false`, preventing further executions due to insufficient approvals. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to spam this function and perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on specific setter functions (detailed in the `Attack Path` section).

[MultiSign::executeSetterFunction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304) function:
```javascript
function executeSetterFunction(
    SetterFunctions _function
) external returns (bool) {
    // Get the number of approvals
    require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals, "Required approvals not met");
    // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Root Cause

The `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction` function lacks access control, allowing it to be called by anyone.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker targets the `Borrowing::setLTV` function.
2. They write a script to repeatedly call `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction` with `_function` parameter set to `SetterFunctions.SetLTV`.
3. If the required number of approvals for `SetterFunctions.SetLTV` has not been reached, the `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction` call reverts without any gas cost to the attacker.
4. If the required number of approvals is sufficient, the `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction` call succeeds, it resets the `approvedToUpdate[_function][owner]` mapping to `false`. This effectively reduces the approvals count to zero.
5. As a result, when the admin attempts to call the `Borrowing::setLTV` function, it reverts due to insufficient approvals.

### Impact

The admin is unable to update critical metrics (e.g., LTV, APR) for core protocol contracts such as `Borrowing` and `CDS`.

### Mitigation

Restrict access to the `MultiSign::executeSetterFunction` by adding a modifier to ensure it can only be called by core contracts (e.g., `Borrowing` and `CDS`).
