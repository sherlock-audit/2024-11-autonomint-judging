# Lack of Validation for odosExecutionData Allows Disruption of Withdrawals

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L898-L907

The absence of validation for the odosExecutionData parameter in the _verify function may allow malicious actors to disrupt the withdrawal process. This could lead to blocked withdrawals or denial-of-service attacks, negatively impacting legitimate users by preventing access to their funds.

#Vulnerability Details
### Root Cause:
The _verify function lacks explicit validation to ensure that odosExecutionData is correctly formatted and contains valid data. This allows malicious users to send invalid or empty data, potentially disrupting operations.
An attacker can exploit the absence of proper validation for odosExecutionData to:

Disrupt Legitimate Withdrawals: By submitting malformed or empty odosExecutionData, the system may fail to process legitimate transactions correctly.

Cause System-Wide Issues: Invalid data could result in failed calls, blocking further executions or causing users' transactions to revert unnecessarily.

# Impact
Blocked Withdrawals: Legitimate withdrawals can be prevented if the protocol encounters invalid data.
System Downtime: Continuous invalid data submission could overload the system or trigger reverts, delaying operations for all users.
Loss of Trust: Users may perceive the protocol as unreliable if such issues persist.

Severity

High
Reasoning: The vulnerability allows unauthorized replay of transactions across chains, potentially leading to significant unauthorized withdrawals or fund transfers.

Likelihood

Medium-High
Reasoning: The likelihood depends on the deployment of the contract across multiple chains (e.g., Optimism and Mode) without additional replay protection mechanisms. If no protective measures are implemented, attackers with knowledge of the vulnerability can easily exploit it.

# Proof of Concept (PoC)
Setup: Deploy the protocol on two chains, Optimism and Mode, without chain-specific signature verification.
Step 1: A user signs a withdrawal transaction on Optimism for excessProfitCumulativeValue = 100 and nonce = 1.
Step 2: The withdrawal on Optimism succeeds and updates the state for that chain.
Step 3: The same signed transaction is sent to the Mode chain.
Result: Since the signature is valid, the Mode chain processes the withdrawal, causing a duplicate transaction and unauthorized asset movement.

#Recommendations
Include Chain ID in Signatures: Modify the digest computation to include a unique identifier for the chain, such as block.chainid. Example:

```solidity

digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
    keccak256(
        abi.encode(
            keccak256("Permit(uint256 chainId,uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,uint256 nonce)"),
            block.chainid,
            excessProfitCumulativeValue,
            nonce
        )
    )
);
```
Unique Nonces per Chain: Maintain separate nonce tracking for each chain to ensure uniqueness across deployments.

Expiration of Signatures: Add a timestamp or block number to limit the validity of signatures.

Validation for odosExecutionData: Ensure odosExecutionData is well-formed and non-empty during the transaction to prevent transaction blocking.
