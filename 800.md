# `GlobalVariables::oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` quotes eth transfer incorrectly

### Summary

`GlobalVariables::lzReceive()` always forwards ETH to the other chain [by](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L595) calling `usda.send()` with the native drop option. However, `GlobalVariables::oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` calculates the eth transfer fee by [quoting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L266-L271) the endpoint directly with just a payload and options, which is different than quoting `usda` directly. As such, the fee charged will be more/less than needed.

### Root Cause

In `GlobalVariables:266`, quote for eth transfer is not fetched from `usda`, but from the endpoint directly, which is wrong as it will always go through `usda` as shown above.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidation of borrower requires extra eth from other chain, so a message to request eth from the other chain is sent.

### Impact

Over/undercharged fee, leading to extra payment or message failures.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Call `usda.quote()`.
