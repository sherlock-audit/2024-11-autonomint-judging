# calculation for Discounted ETH is wrong.

### Summary

Discounted ETH is supposed to be  80% of half of the deposited amount but the calculation in `BorrowLib.calculateDiscountedETH()` is wrong as it fails to divide the total calculation by 100 to actually reflect the  80% of half of the deposited amount.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L127-L128

### Root Cause

```solidity
   function calculateDiscountedETH(
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 ethPrice
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        // 80% of half of the deposited amount
        return (80 * calculateHalfValue(amount) * ethPrice) / (USDA_PRECISION * 1e4);//@audit-issue not really 80% (should / total by 100)
    }
```
This -> `(80 * calculateHalfValue(amount) * ethPrice) / (USDA_PRECISION * 1e4)` is wrong and doesn't reflect the 80% of the value aimed to calculate because the whole thing is not later divided by 100.

The correct one would be `((80 * calculateHalfValue(amount) * ethPrice) / (USDA_PRECISION * 1e4)) / 100`.

### Impact

This bug affects ETH Collateral withdrawals in `BorrowLib.withdraw()` where ABOND USDA pool needs to be updated with `discountedCollateral`. And  `discountedCollateral` is supposed to be 80% of half of user's deposited amount BUT `discountedCollateral` won't be 80% of half of the deposited amount and wrong values will be updated to ABOND USDA pool.

Also `discountedCollateral` minted as AbondToken will be greater than 80% of half of their deposited amount due to this bug

Users will have more gain than should be for users as more AbondTokens will be minted for them than should be.

For example: 
- let half value of Alice's deposit be 500. 
- And Eth price 3300$
- in current calculation we'll have 80 x 500 x 3,300 / 1e12 x 1e4 = 0.0000000132
- but the actual value should had been (80 x 500 x 3,300 / 1e12 x 1e4) / 100 = 0.000000000132

So the 80% of Alice's half amount of 500 at ETH price being 3,300$ is supposed to be = 0.000000000132. But due to this bug it will be 0.0000000132.


```solidity
// Mint the ABondTokens
                    depositDetail.aBondTokensAmount = mintAbondToken(
                        interfaces.abond,
                        params.bondRatio,
                        msg.sender,
                        params.index,
                        discountedCollateral //@audit-issue faulty value 
                    );
```

### Mitigation

Correct this -> `(80 * calculateHalfValue(amount) * ethPrice) / (USDA_PRECISION * 1e4)` to this ->   `((80 * calculateHalfValue(amount) * ethPrice) / (USDA_PRECISION * 1e4)) / 100`.
