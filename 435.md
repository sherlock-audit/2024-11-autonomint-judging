### PoC

**Textual PoC:**

userA deposit 1 ETH as collateral when ETH price is $1000 and he/she expect to get 800 usda as loan when LTV is 80% but when his/her transaction will be executed ETH price become $900 and users get 700 usda as loan instead of 800 usda 

### Impact

users get loan less than expected

### Mitigation

Consider to add min receive amount to deposit function
