# _lzReceive in GlobalVariables, is setting the refund address to itself, but there is no way to recover the refunded funds

### Summary

The `_lzReceive()` function in `GlobalVariables.so`l is intended to receive cross-chain responses and send requested funds. However, the refund address for the send-back operation is set to the GlobalVariables contract itself, leaving no mechanism to retrieve the refunded funds.

### Root Cause

The refund address for `.send()` operations is set to a contract that cannot retrieve the refunded funds. References where the refund address is set to `GlobalVariables.sol`.

```solidity
usda.send{value: _fee.nativeFee}(_sendParam, _fee, address(this));
```

### Attack Path

1. During normal operations, assets need to be transferred cross-chain.
2. The chain processing the request sends the funds back via the `_lzReceive()` function in `GlobalVariables.sol`.
3. The address for excess fee refunds is set to the GlobalVariables contract itself, which lacks a mechanism to withdraw the funds.

### Impact

- Refunded fee funds become stuck in the contract and can accumulate to a significant amount, making them permanently inaccessible.

### Mitigation

Either change the refund address to an accessible address or add a withdrawal mechanism to the contract.
