# Circuit breakers are not validated when retrieving prices from Chainlink's oracle

### Summary

For ETH price retrievement and exchange rate calculation the protocol utilises the Chainlink oracle for the Optimism chain. However every price feed has min and max value and due to the circuit breaker, if an asset's price moves outside of these min/max thresholds, the received answer will still be capped. 

### Root Cause

```javascript
function _price(
        address underlying
    ) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
        ...
        } else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
@>          (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);   
            }
```

As per Chainlink docs: "On most data feeds, these values are no longer used and they do not prevent your application from reading the most recent answer.". However, this is not the case for Optimism chain because these values are still used. For example the most important one: 

- [ETH/USD](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9#readContract)

### Impact

This will lead to an incorrect price, if the actual price falls below the `minAnswer`, Chainlink will still continue providing the capped value instead of the real one. Let's look at what impact this scenario can have on the protocol:

in borrowing contract, the eth price is used for:

1. cds/borrow ratio calculation (if it's below 0.2 ratio users should not be able to mint new tokens or cds owners to withdraw), however with the capped price, the ratio might be sufficient to borrow or withdraw, whereas with the real price, the ratio can be below 0.2 and they should not be allowed. This breaks the only invariant provided by the dev team in the README.

2. option fees paid by borrower can be more than they should, because capped price will be > than the real one

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L681-L684
3. will calculate a wrong cumulative value in cds contract

Overall, it will break the accounting, because the protocol will operate with stale prices

Per Sherlock rules: "Chainlink Price Checks: Issues related to minAnswer and maxAnswer checks on Chainlink's Price Feeds are considered medium only if the Watson explicitly mentions the price feeds (e.g. USDC/ETH) that require this check.
