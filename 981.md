# Missing Heartbeat Interval and Zero-Price Checks in Redstone Oracle Implementation in `MasterPriceOracle`

### Summary

The protocol uses Redstone Oracles to fetch prices of underlying assets and ETH. However, the implementation lacks critical safety checks, such as heartbeat interval validation and prices > 0 verification. These omissions can lead to stale prices or zero prices being accepted from the oracle in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L63C13-L78C108), resulting in incorrect price calculations and potential financial losses for the protocol and its users.  


The protocol must check the heartbeat interval mentioned here in [Redstone Feeds](https://app.redstone.finance/app/feeds/) to ensure no stale price is returned and should never allow zero-prices.


### Root Cause

The absence of heartbeat interval checks and price > 0 validation in the Redstone Oracle integration logic allows stale or incorrect prices to be accepted and used in calculations.  


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The Redstone Oracle returns a stale price due to delayed updates or network issues, and the protocol does not validate the price's freshness.  
2. The protocol accepts a price of `0` from the oracle, which leads to the use of stale or zero prices to perform operations, enabling potential exploitation or resulting in incorrect financial outcomes.  

### Impact

- The protocol may execute incorrect operations based on stale or zero prices, causing fund mismanagement or unintended payouts.  
-Attackers could leverage stale or zero prices to manipulate the protocol for financial gain.  
- Users may lose confidence in the protocol due to inaccuracies and financial risks stemming from improper oracle price validation.  


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check for heartbeat interval against last updated timestamp and ensure prices from the Oracle are greater than zero.
