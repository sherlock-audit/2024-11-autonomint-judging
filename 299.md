# Logical error in Treasury::withdraw function causes constant reverts

### Summary

The `Treasury::withdraw` function always reverts due to an incorrect check of the `depositDetails.withdrawed` flag.

[Treasury::withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L226) function:
```javascript
function withdraw(
    address borrower,
    address toAddress,
    uint256 amount,
    uint128 exchangeRate,
    uint64 index
) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (bool) {
    ...
    // Get the borrower deposit details
    DepositDetails memory depositDetails = borrowing[borrower].depositDetails[index];
    // check the deposit already withdrew or not
=>  require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
    ...
}
```
The default value of `depositDetails.withdrawed` is `false`, and it is updated to `true` only after a successful withdrawal. Consequently, the condition `require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn")` always causes a revert.

### Root Cause

The `depositDetails.withdrawed` flag is initialized to `false` and only updated to `true` after a successful withdrawal. The `require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn")` check always fails, preventing any withdrawal attempt.

### Impact

The `Treasury::withdraw` function always reverts, making it impossible to perform withdrawals.

### Mitigation

Update the logic of this function to correctly handle the `depositDetails.withdrawed` flag. Specifically, replace the require condition to check that the withdrawal has not already been performed (i.e., `require(!depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn")`).
