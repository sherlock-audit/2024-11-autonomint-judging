# Repaying the loan and withdrawing collateral doesn't check the validity of the option

### Summary

When depositing and borrowing against the deposited collateral, user has 20% of his funds protected by downside volatility due to the option that he acquires and pays fee on it.

It is valid for 30 days as per docs, but nowhere in the code is the validity of it checked - the value responsible for tracking the validity of an option is `optionsRenewedTimeStamp`.

We can see it is being set in `Treasury.deposit()` and reset in `borrowing::renewOptions()`, but it is not enforced in a critical function such as `borrowLib::withdraw()`, so a user can just bypass renewing his option and be protected by downside volatility.

### Root Cause

The root cause is not checking the validity in functions such as `borrowLib::withdraw()`, making the user not obliged to renew his option, causing a loss of option fees to the CDS holders and saving users money that should have been paid for `optionFees`

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User deposits tokens and takes a loan via `depositTokens()`
2. User decides to repay the loan via `withdraw()` after 6 months and using the downside protection for 6 months that should have been only for 1 month, thus the option fees that he should've been paid for renewing the option.

### Impact

User will pay only during deposit option fees and then be not obliged to renew the option.

CDS holders will lose on option fees, thus disincentivizing them to protect borrowers from downside volatility

### PoC

### Mitigation

Create a logic that tracks the validity of option fees, so that users are obliged to pay them.
