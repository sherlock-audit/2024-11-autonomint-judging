# Incorrect borrowingHealth Check Implementation in `BorrowLib::withdraw`

### Summary


The `borrowing::withdraw` and `borrowLiquidation::liquidateBorrowPosition` functions have issues with the implementation of the ratio check logic. These issues can lead to unintended behavior, such as allowing  withdrawals that should not be permitted under the intended rules.

1. The `liquidateBorrowPosition` function allows liquidation only if the ratio is below or equal to 0.8 (8000).
2. The `withdraw` function has an incorrect condition to verify the health of the borrowing position. The `borrowingHealth` is checked using `if (borrowingHealth < 8000)` but fails to revert if `borrowingHealth` is *equal to* `8000`. This contradicts the comment, which states, "Check the health is greater than 0.8." The logic also allows withdrawals when the borrowing health is exactly 8000.


### Root Cause


The withdrawal function misinterprets the intended threshold for borrowing health. The condition `if (borrowingHealth < 8000)` allows execution when `borrowingHealth == 8000`.

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail,
        IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Params memory params,
        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces
    ) external returns (IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Result memory) {

            //...

            // Calculate the borrowingHealth
            uint128 borrowingHealth = calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, params.ethPrice);

            // Check the health is grater thsn 0.8
@>>            if (borrowingHealth < 8000) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();
            
            //...
```

The `liquidateBorrowPosition` function allows liquidation only if the ratio is below or equal to 0.8 (8000).

```solidity
    function liquidationType1(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {

        //...
        // Get the exchange rate and ETH price
        (uint128 exchangeRate /*uint128 ethPrice*/, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));

        // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
@>>        require(ratio <= 8000,"You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

        //...
```

If the `calculateEthPriceRatio` function returns `8000`, at that value, the position becomes eligible for liquidation. This indicates that the collateral-to-debt ratio has fallen below the liquidation threshold, making the position unsafe. At this stage, the user is still allowed to withdraw funds if the protocol permits withdrawals even in undercollateralized states. However, if the user withdraws first, reducing the collateral even further, and then liquidation happens on that same position, it could lead to a situation where the protocol's treasury or CDS pool incurs a loss and burn this `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` amount from treasury that user already burn and withdrawn thier collateral.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Current ETH price must be provided accurately to both functions (`liquidateBorrowPosition` and `withdraw`).

### Attack Path


1. A user identifies their borrowing health as exactly 8000.  
2. The user calls the `withdraw` function, bypassing the intended restriction that borrowing health must be strictly greater than 8000.  
3. This allows the user to withdraw collateral despite being eligible to liquidation.  
4. The admin calls the `borrowing::liquidate` function to liquidate this position.  
5. The `liquidationType1` function passes the check `ratio <= 8000` because the position is eligible for liquidation.  
6. After the state updates, the call `usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), depositDetail.borrowedAmount)` burns this amount from the treasury, resulting in a loss of funds for the protocol because the USDA backing collateral has already been withdrawn by the user.  



### Impact


Borrowers can withdraw collateral even when their position is not sufficiently healthy, potentially leaving the protocol under-collateralized.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Correct the borrowingHealth to `borrowingHealth <= 8000` to align with the intended behavior.

```diff
    function withdraw(
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail,
        IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Params memory params,

    ) external returns (IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Result memory) {

            //...

            // Calculate the borrowingHealth
            uint128 borrowingHealth = calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, params.ethPrice);

            // Check the health is grater thsn 0.8
-            if (borrowingHealth < 8000) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();
