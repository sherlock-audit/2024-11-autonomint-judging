# User Funds Locked When `downsideProtected` is Less Than Available CDS Deposited Amount

### Summary

If the `downsideProtected` amount required is smaller than the amount returned by `cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()`, the function only updates the downside protection and burns USDA tokens from the treasury. However, the user's `msg.value` remains stuck in the contract, resulting in a loss of user funds.


### Root Cause


In `_withdraw` internal function we have a logic that the `downsideProtected` amount that is return from `BorrowLib.withdraw` is non zero, so we don't send the remaining ETH to Borrower and we call `_getDownsideFromCDS` that pass `Eth - fee.nativeFee` amount of native tokens for OFT fees that execute the `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` function in the globalVariables contract.

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        //...

        // if there is a downside, get it from cds
        {if (result.downsideProtected > 0) {
            _getDownsideFromCDS(result.downsideProtected, msg.value - fee.nativeFee);
        } else {
            // Send the remaining ETH to Borrower
            (bool sent, ) = payable(toAddress).call{value: msg.value - fee.nativeFee}("");
            if (!sent) revert Borrow_TransferFailed();
        }

        // update the state variables
        totalNormalizedAmount = result.totalNormalizedAmount;
        collateralRemainingInWithdraw = result.collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw = result.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw;

        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}

        //...
    }
```

If the `downsideProtected` amount is less than the total CDS deposited amount `cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount`, the `updateDownsideProtected` value in the CDS contract is updated, and the downsideProtected amount is burned from the treasury. However, the user `msg.value` that is not send to `feeForOFT` will be permanently lock in the contract.

```solidity
  function _getDownsideFromCDS(
        uint128 downsideProtected,
        uint256 feeForOFT
    ) internal {
        if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
            // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
            globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: feeForOFT}(
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
                IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),downsideProtected - cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()),
                // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
                IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
                IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_WITHDRAW,
                msg.sender
            );
        } else {
            // updating downside protected from this chain in CDS
            cds.updateDownsideProtected(downsideProtected);
        }
        // Burn the borrow amount
        treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, address(this), downsideProtected);
        bool success = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), downsideProtected);
        if (!success) revert Borrow_BurnFailed();
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- The return value of `result.downsideProtected` must be non zero 
- The `cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount` return amount is greater then `downsideProtected` amount


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. A user with a valid collateral position attempts to withdraw their funds and send native tokens to cover lz tx `fee.nativeFee` and `feeForOFT`.
2. The required `downsideProtected` amount smaller the amount available in `cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()`.
3. The protocol executes the `_getDownsideFromCDS` function, burning USDA tokens but failing to refund the unused `msg.value` to the user.
4. The user's provided ETH (`msg.value`) is permanently locked in the contract, leading to a loss of funds.


### Impact

Loss of user funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Add proper handling for cases where `downsideProtected` smaller then the available CDS amount. Ensure that any unused `msg.value` is refunded to the user.

  function _getDownsideFromCDS(
        uint128 downsideProtected,

            globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: feeForOFT}(
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
