# Reversion During Liquidation Due to Exchange Rate Decrease

### Summary

The code related to liquidation is prone to reversion when the exchange rate at the time of liquidation is lower than the exchange rate during the deposit. This happens because the calculation for the yield involves subtracting an amount derived from the exchange rate. If the current exchange rate is lower than the initial exchange rate used for the deposit, the formula will produce a negative value, causing a reversion. This scenario must be handled explicitly to prevent liquidation failures and this snenerio can occur when a borrower is due to be liquidated.

### Root Cause

**Exchange Rate Decrease**:

During liquidation, the code compares the current exchange rate with the exchange rate used during the deposit.
If the current exchange rate is lower than the deposit's exchange rate, the calculation for `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH` (which is derived from the exchange rate) results in a number greater than `depositDetail.depositedAmount`.
This causes the following formula to produce a negative result:

**Reversion Condition**:

The subtraction yields a value greater than the deposited amount, triggering a reversion and preventing the liquidation from completing.

### Impact

1. When the exchange rate decreases during liquidation, the code fails to process the liquidation, resulting in a stuck or unprocessed liquidation for the user. 

2. The failure to complete the liquidation may result in a loss of liquidity and capital for both the protocol and the user, especially during volatile market conditions.

### Mitigation

```diff
+if(depositDetail.depositedAmount > ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)){
  uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
+}
```
