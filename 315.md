# Lack of Ether refund to users

### Summary

Users will lose some remaining Ether because we lack of ether refund

### Root Cause

In [borrrowing:depositTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L228), users will borrow USDA via depositing Ether.

This function is marked `payable`. Because we need to send one cross-chain message to the other chain to update the global data. So users need to pay some Ether for the Layerzero fee.

The problem is that Layerzero's transfer fee is not one fixed value according to LayerZero's doc(https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/tx-pricing). The transfer fee is flexible. As one normal user, it's impossible to enter the exact transfer fee. So users need to input a little bit more transfer fee than estimated value to make sure transaction succeed. The part (msg.value - fee.nativeFee) will be locked in this contract.

```solidity
    function depositTokens(
        BorrowDepositParams memory depositParam
        // Function 0 --> borrow deposit.
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(0)) {
    ...
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositParam.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender // msg.sender is the refund address.
        );
    ...
}
```
