# All the interest earned from liquidation is stuck in the treasury forever

### Summary

When liquidating a position, the [total interest accrued](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L272) to the position up until the time of the point of liquidation are stored in the `totalInterestFromLiquidation` variable.

```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
272:  @>     treasury.updateTotalInterestFromLiquidation(totalInterestFromLiquidation);

```

### Root Cause

However, when the `owner` calls [`Treasury::withdrawInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L621-L622) to withdraw the interest, only the `totalInterest` is available to be withdrawn

```solidity
File: Treasury.sol
616:     function withdrawInterest(
617:         address toAddress,
618:         uint256 amount
619:     ) external onlyOwner {
620:         require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
621:   @>    require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
622:         totalInterest -= amount;
623:         bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
624:         require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
625:     }

```

Hence the `totalInterestFromLiquidation` is stuck in the `Treasury` contract

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

THis leads to loss of funds as the funds are irretrievable stuck without a way to retrieve them

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider reimplementing the `Treasury::withdrawInterest()` to ensure `totalInterestFromLiquidation` is available for withdrawal
