# updateDownsideProtected() has no access control mechanism

### Summary

`updateDownsideProtected()` has no access control, which gives a malicious actor to add whatever value he wants to increment `downsideProtected`.

Given that `downsideProtected` is used to decrement `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`,
in `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()`. 

A user can just place the max value of `downsideProtected` and **underflow both variables every single time during depositing or withdrawing funds**.

This makes calling `deposit()` not possible and the users who've already deposited, can't get their funds back via `withdraw()`, highlighting how a simple lack of access control causes funds to be stuck, as well as breaking core functionality - rendering the protocol unusable.

### Root Cause

The root cause is lack of access control in `updateDownsideProtected()`, giving the possibility of a malicious actor to put whatever value he wants as `downsideProtected` via the function params.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious actor calls `updateDownsideProtected()` passing the maximum possible value
2. Victim calls `withdraw()` to get his funds back, but it reverts [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L324), thus losing his deposited funds forever.

### Impact

Funds can't be withdrawn, as well as new funds can't be deposited, thus losing funds and making the protocol unusable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control check, so that it can't be called just from everyone
