# Attacker can steal all usdt from treasury through `CDS.sol#redeemUSDT()`.

### Summary

Missing validation check of usda and usdt price will cause loss of funds for protocol as an attacker can pass invalid usda and usdt prices.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L510

### Root Cause

- In `CDS.sol#redeemUSDT()`, there is no validation check of usdt and usda prices passed as parameter by user.
```solidity
    function redeemUSDT(
        uint128 usdaAmount,
@>      uint64 usdaPrice,
@>      uint64 usdtPrice
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(6)) {
        burnedUSDaInRedeem = CDSLib.redeemUSDT(
            Interfaces(
                treasury,
                globalVariables,
                usda,
                usdt,
                borrowing,
                CDSInterface(address(this))
            ),
            burnedUSDaInRedeem,
            usdaAmount,
@>          usdaPrice,
@>          usdtPrice
        );

        ...
    }
```
- In `CDSLib.sol:404`, usdt amount is calculated by prices passed by user without any validation check.
```solidity
    // calculate the USDT USDa ratio
    uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- Some depositors deposits usdt to treasury through `CDS.sol#deposit()`.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Attacker calls `CDS.sol#redeemUSDT` with malicious prices of usdt and usda.
  There is no limit for amount which the attacker can steal. 


### Impact

An attacker can steal all usdt from protocol.

### PoC

- We say that treasury has 1000_000e6 of usdt.
- An attacker can steal all of this by using only 1 of usda.
- The attacker calls `CDS.sol#redeemUSDT` with following parameters: usdaAmount = 1, usdaPrice = 1000_000e6, usdtPrice = 1.
- This call succeeds because there isn't any validation check for these prices.


### Mitigation

There can be several ways for mitigation of this vulnerability.
1. Add `onlyAdmin` modifier to `CDS.sol#redeemUSDT`.
2. Configure trusted oracle for usda and usdt prices.
3. Use signature with deadline, nonce and msg.sender for validating prices of usda and usdt.
