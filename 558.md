# MasterPriceOracle may return stale prices

### Summary

MasterPriceOracle is intended to return price data from a Chainlink oracle when the block.chainId is 10, however, there is no validation on whether the data is not stale.

### Root Cause

In MasterPriceOracle._price it is not checked whether the data is stale nor whether the the returned price is not 0:

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The oracle is used in many parts of the protocol, this is a simple example with the CDS.sol contract:

1. Chainlink returns stale data.
2. MasterPriceOracle._price does not detect the issue and stale pricing is used in the CDS withdraw function.
3. The price is higher then it should be, causing the current cumulative value to be higher than intended.
4. Due to the higher cumulative value  `cdsAmountToReturn` returns higher profits for the withdrawer.

### Impact

The oracle is used in many parts of the protocol. In some scenarios a user can receive more funds than they should be able to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add stale data validation to `MasterPriceOracle._price`.
