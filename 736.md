# There is no time constraint implemented for price downside protection when USDa borrowers withdraw their collateral, resulting in potential losses to the protocolâ€™s funds.

## Severity: High

## Vulnerability Details

According to the documentation, the duration of price downside protection is limited to one month. If the duration has expired, users are required to renew their options by calling `borrowing::renewOptions`.

To address this, the protocol should record the deposit time when USDa borrowers provide their collateral to borrow stablecoins and calculate the elapsed duration when they withdraw their collateral. This would determine whether the price downside protection should still be applied.

However, after reviewing the relevant code (`borrowing::depositTokens`, `borrowing::_withdraw`, and `BorrowLib::withdraw`), it appears that this mechanism has not been implemented.

## Impact

Marking this as High severity as it both could happen intentionally (Malicious users may deliberately exploit this vulnerability to gain extended price protection at a reduced option fee cost while redeeming more collateral) and also with normal behaviour in high eth volatility markets where a USDa borrower could gain profits unintendly during his withdrawal, finally causing large losses to the Treasury's Vault.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Implement the `setWithdrawTimeLimitBorrow` Function**:
   - Create a function named `setWithdrawTimeLimitBorrow` that allows only the admin to set the withdrawal time limit for borrowing.
2. **Record `depositedTime` in `borrowing::depositTokens`**:

   - Update the `depositTokens` function to log the current block timestamp (`block.timestamp`) as `depositedTime` whenever a user deposits collateral.

3. **Calculate Borrowing Duration and Adjust Protection**:
   - During collateral withdrawal, calculate the borrowing duration by subtracting `depositedTime` from the current block timestamp.
   - If the duration exceeds `withdrawTimeLimitBorrow` and the user has not renewed their options, reduce the price downside protection to 10%.
