# Wrong Asset is used to get the exchangeRate of rsETH

### Summary

On withdrawing via `CDS::withdraw()` the function collected the exchange rate of different assets. But in case of rsETH, the asset for the exchange rate calculation was chosen to be WrsETH.


### Root Cause


The exchange rate calculation of asset is done by borrowing.getUSDValue function, but in this  we are passing the address of WrsETH instead of rsETH, both are two different types of assets hence will give wrong values.

They may trade at different values due to:

- Supply/demand dynamics
- Liquidity differences
- Market adoption


```solidity
       (uint128 rsETH_ExchangeRate, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(
            borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH)
        );
        // @audit this is getting a wrong value/ should be rsETH instead of WrsETH

```

### Impact

`rsETH_ExchangeRate` is passed as WithdrawUserParams to CDSLib.withdrawUser and it is used to calculate the yields which is accured between liquidation and now and calculate rsETH amount. So exchange is wrong the whole system will updated with wrong values leading to miscalculation of rsETH asset amount on withdraw.

### Mitigation

Use rsETH address instead of WrsETH
