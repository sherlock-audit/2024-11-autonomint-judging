# Lack of Access Controls in `calculateCumulativeRate()` Enables Rate Manipulation

## Vulnerability Details:
The calculateCumulativeRate function is publicly accessible and modifies critical protocol state (lastCumulativeRate) without any access control mechanisms, allowing any external actor to manipulate the protocol's interest rate calculations.

## PoC:
Here's a scenario-based Proof of Concept for the public access vulnerability:

*Initial Setup:*
1. Protocol State:
   - Current lastCumulativeRate: 1000
   - lastEventTime: 1 hour ago
   - ratePerSec: 0.0001% (standard rate)
   - noOfBorrowers: 100

*Attack Scenario:*
Step 1: Normal Operation
- Protocol expects rate update once per hour
- Rate should increase gradually based on time passed

Step 2: Attacker's Actions
- Attacker spots public access to calculateCumulativeRate()
- Calls function repeatedly within short timeframe:
  * Call 1: Updates lastCumulativeRate
  * Call 2: Immediately updates it again
  * Call 3: And again...
  
Step 3: Impact
- Each call forces a new rate calculation
- Updates lastCumulativeRate without proper time gaps
- Accelerates rate accumulation artificially
- Affects all borrower positions in protocol
