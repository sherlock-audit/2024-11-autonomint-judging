# Multiple Unsafe Arithmetic Operations

### Summary
The below referenced lines all perform unsafe multiplication using unitary denomination of 1 ether (1e18) this can easily lead to overflow when used as multiplier for large amounts of assets.

### Root Cause
Using unitary denomination of 1 ether (1e18), 1e11, 1e10 in most calculations.

### Internal pre-conditions


none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
Overflow issues in calculations can result in incorrect balances or values, leading to potential loss of user funds or mismanagement of system assets.



### PoC
Issue is deducible by inspecting the relevant lines referenced in the summary and making note of the raw multiplication ( * ) operation performed

### Mitigation

Use the ds-math library or openzeppelin SafeMath library.
