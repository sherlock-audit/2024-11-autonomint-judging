# `BorrowLiquidation.setTreasury` and `setAdmin` Functions Violate Access Control Specifications

### Summary

The `BorrowLiquidation` contract's `setTreasury` and `setAdmin` functions can be called by the contract owner without requiring multisig approval, violating the specified access control constraints. According to the readMe, `setTreasury()` can be called only by the Admin, not the Owner, and must require multisig approval. Additionally, inputs should be validated to ensure they are not zero addresses or externally owned accounts (EOAs). The current implementation allows the Owner to unilaterally change critical contract parameters without the necessary restrictions, posing significant security risks.

### Root Cause

- **Incorrect Access Control:** The `setTreasury` and `setAdmin` functions in `BorrowLiquidation` use the `onlyOwner` modifier, allowing the Owner to execute these functions. However, the specifications state that only the Admin should be able to call these functions.
  
- **Lack of Multisig Approval:** There is no check for multisig approval in `BorrowLiquidation.setTreasury`, contrary to the requirement that the Admin must have approval from multisig for setting the treasury address.

- **Potential Ownership Misalignment:** The Owner is initialized as the `msg.sender` during contract deployment, which may not be the designated Admin in practice, leading to potential misuse if the Owner is a different entity.

```solidity
contract BorrowLiquidation is /* ... */ OwnableUpgradeable /* ... */ {
    // ...

    function initialize(
        address borrowingAddress,
        // ...
    ) public initializer {
        // Initialize owner
        __Ownable_init(msg.sender);
        // ...
    }

    // ...

    function setTreasury(address treasuryAddress) external onlyOwner {
        // Check whether the input address is not a zero address and EOA
        require(
            treasuryAddress != address(0) && isContract(treasuryAddress),
            "Treasury must be contract address & can't be zero address"
        );
        treasury = ITreasury(treasuryAddress);
    }

    function setAdmin(address adminAddress) external onlyOwner {
        // Check whether the input address is not a zero address and EOA
        require(
            adminAddress != address(0) && !isContract(adminAddress),
            "Admin can't be zero address and contract address"
        );
        admin = adminAddress;
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Attack Path

1. **Unauthorized Treasury Change:**

   - A malicious Owner of the `BorrowLiquidation` contract calls `setTreasury` to set the treasury address to a malicious contract they control.
   - No multisig approval is required, and the Admin cannot prevent this action.
   - Funds intended for the legitimate treasury are redirected to the malicious address.

2. **Unauthorized Admin Change:**

   - The Owner calls `setAdmin` to set the Admin address to an address under their control.
   - This compromise allows the Owner to indirectly control functions intended for the Admin.

### Impact

`setTreasury` should be callable only by Admin with multisig approval, but it's callable by Owner without multisig.

### Expected Behavior According to Specifications

- **Function Call Restrictions:**
  - `setTreasury()` can be called only by Admin, not Owner.
  - `setTreasury()` requires multisig approval.
  - Inputs must be validated to prevent zero addresses and EOAs.

### PoC

1. **Owner Changes Treasury Without Multisig Approval:**

   ```solidity
   // As the Owner of BorrowLiquidation, call setTreasury
   borrowLiquidation.setTreasury(maliciousTreasuryAddress);
   // No multisig approval is checked
   ```

2. **Owner Changes Admin Address:**

   ```solidity
   // Owner sets admin to a malicious address
   borrowLiquidation.setAdmin(maliciousAdminAddress);
   // The Owner can now indirectly control admin-restricted functions
   ```

### Mitigation

**Restrict Access to Admin with Multisig Approval:**

  Modify the `setTreasury` function to:

  - Use the `onlyAdmin` modifier instead of `onlyOwner`.
  - Require multisig approval before executing.

  ```solidity
  function setTreasury(address treasuryAddress) external onlyAdmin {
      // Check whether the input address is not a zero address and EOA
      require(
          treasuryAddress != address(0) && isContract(treasuryAddress),
          "Treasury must be contract address & can't be zero address"
      );
      // Require multisig approval
      require(
          multiSign.executeSetterFunction(IMultiSign.SetterFunctions(5)),
          "Required approvals not met to set treasury"
      );
      treasury = ITreasury(treasuryAddress);
  }
  ```

- **Ensure Admin is Properly Assigned and Controlled:**

  - In the `initialize` function, set the Admin address explicitly, ensuring it aligns with the intended Admin entity.

  ```solidity
  function initialize(
      address borrowingAddress,
      // ...
      address adminAddress
  ) public initializer {
      // Initialize owner
      __Ownable_init(msg.sender);
      // Set Admin address
      admin = adminAddress;
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **Implement `onlyAdmin` Modifier:**

  Add an `onlyAdmin` modifier in `BorrowLiquidation.sol`:

  ```solidity
  modifier onlyAdmin() {
      require(msg.sender == admin, "Caller is not the admin");
      _;
  }
  ```


- **Integrate Multisig Approval Mechanism:**

  - Introduce a multisig interface or import the existing one.
  - Use it to check for required approvals in `setTreasury`
