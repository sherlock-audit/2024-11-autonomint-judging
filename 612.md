# `depositTokens` of `deposit` does not verify the relationship between `strikePercent` and `strikePrice`.

### Summary

`depositTokens` of `deposit` does not verify the relationship between `strikePercent` and `strikePrice`. Both they are provided by the user. The option fee is calculated by `strikePercent`, while the `calculateStrikePriceGains` function is called by `strikePrice` during withdrawal. As a result, if the user inputs an arbitrary `strikePrice` lower than the current price and withdraws, the treasury will be drained.

```solidity
    function calculateOptionPrice(
        uint128 _ethPrice,
        uint256 _ethVolatility,
        uint256 _amount,
        StrikePrice _strikePrice
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
```

### Root Cause

`depositTokens` does not verify the relationship between `strikePercent` and `strikePrice`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. CDS Pool needs to have some funds.

### External pre-conditions

1. ETHPriceAtDeposited < Current Price

### Attack Path

1. The user deposits ETH with a `strikePrice` lower than the current price.
2. If the current price increases, the user withdraws the deposit.
3. They profit the difference: (current price - `strikePrice`) * amount.

### Impact

the treasury will be drained

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It might be better to allow users to input only the `strikePercent`, while `strikePrice` is calculated by the protocol code.
