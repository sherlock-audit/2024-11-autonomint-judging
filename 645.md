# In `Borrowing::redeemYields` the `usdaGainedDuringLiquidation` is obtained from `Treasury` and not from `omniChainData` which causes `ABOND` holders to lose profits

### Summary

During `ABOND` redemption, users are compensated with `USDa` that was taken as profit for the `USDA:ABOND` pool during liquidations. However, the compensation they get is from the amount gained from liquidations in the chain the redemption is occurring and it does not take into account the `USDa` gained from liquidations in the second chain. In addition to improperly compensating `ABOND` redeemers, it will create `ABOND` price disparity in the two chains because there will be more yield to redeem in one chain than in the other.

### Root Cause

The amount calculated to send to the redeemer `usdaToTransfer` is calculated with data of the chain where redemption is occurring:

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

- Loss of funds for `ABOND` holders
- Price disparity of `ABOND` in the two chains

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Ensure to use `omniChainData` for calculations and add a mechanism to pay the `USDa` in the other chain if there are not enough funds where the redemption is occurring.
