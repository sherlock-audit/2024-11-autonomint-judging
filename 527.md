# `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` is not updated during withdrawal for users who did not opt in for liquidation

### Summary

When users who did not opt in for liquidation are withdrawing their asset, the 10% deducted from the final amount is accounted for in the treasury. Thus causing the amount to be lost entirely.


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L890-L895

### Root Cause

The problem is that the `treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw()` is not called to update the `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` with this 10% hence this funds are completely lost

```solidity
File: CDSLib.sol
864: 
865:     function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(
866:         CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
867:         CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
868:         uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
869:         uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
870:     ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {

//////       ..................
889: 
890:         // Call calculateUserProportionInWithdraw in cds library to get usda to transfer to user @audit HIGH: what happens to the remaining 10% of the profit because it has been removed form the totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees => this is lost
891:   @>    params.usdaToTransfer = calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, params.returnAmount);
892:         // Update user deposit details
893:         params.cdsDepositDetails.withdrawedAmount = params.usdaToTransfer;
894:         params.cdsDepositDetails.optionFees = params.optionFees;
895:         params.cdsDepositDetails.optionFeesWithdrawn = params.optionFees;
