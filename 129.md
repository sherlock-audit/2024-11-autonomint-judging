# Excess ether not refunded to users in `depositTokens` function

### Summary

The `depositTokens` function receives Ether from the user to cover LayerZero transaction fees. However, it does not refund any excess Ether after calculating the exact required fee (`fee.nativeFee`). This creates a poor user experience, as users must estimate the required fee and overpayment is not returned. It can also lead to user dissatisfaction or financial loss.
Exact fee estimate is not easy for user because gas price and change of data can cause changed fee.

Excess ether must be refunded like here:

### Root Cause

- The `depositTokens` function receives Ether (`msg.value`) to pay for LayerZero messaging fees (`fee.nativeFee`).  
- The excess Ether is not refunded to the user, unlike in the `_withdraw` function, which returns the unused Ether.  
- Users are forced to overpay due to the difficulty in calculating the exact required Ether, especially given fluctuations in gas prices and network conditions.

### Impact

- Users lose funds unnecessarily due to overpayment.
- Can result in users overestimating the Ether amount, locking more funds than needed.

### Mitigation

Introduce logic to calculate and refund excess Ether to the user in the `depositTokens` function.
