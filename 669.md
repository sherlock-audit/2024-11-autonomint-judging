# Missing Update Function for `yieldsFromLrts` and Incorrect Update of `yieldsFromLiquidatedLrts`

### Summary

There is an inconsistency in the handling of the two variables `yieldsFromLrts` and `yieldsFromLiquidatedLrts`. Both are meant to be updated at different points during the liquidation and withdrawal processes, but the current implementation updates `yieldsFromLiquidatedLrts` in both places (during withdrawal and liquidation) through the `updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts` function. Meanwhile, there is no corresponding function to update `yieldsFromLrts`, leading to the possibility of stale or incorrect data for this variable during withdrawals.

1. As per the comment, `yieldsFromLiquidatedLrts` should only be updated during liquidation. However, it is currently being updated during withdrawals as well, which goes against the intended logic for separating the two types of yield updates.

2. As per the comment, `yieldsFromLrts` is to be updated during withdrawal. but its not

3. And also there is no corresponding function that updates the yieldsFromLrts variable during withdrawals, leading to the possibility of yieldsFromLrts being incorrectly left unchanged during required operations.

### Impact

If these yield variables are exposed to users (for example, in a UI or for accounting purposes), the incorrect tracking of yields might lead to confusing or misleading information being presented to the user, especially when trying to track or reconcile different sources of yield (liquidation vs. regular yield).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A new function should be added to the system to update the yieldsFromLrts variable during withdrawals. This function should be invoked in the appropriate part of the withdrawal process where regular LRTs are involved.
