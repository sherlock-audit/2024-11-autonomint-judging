# Fixed Scaling Factor in Cumulative Value Calculation Enables Price Movement Value Extraction

## Summary
A critical vulnerability exists in the CDS contract's `calculateCumulativeValue` mechanism that enables value extraction through improper price movement scaling. The root cause is twofold: the function uses a static "_amount = 1000" constant in its core calculation formula `value = (_amount * vaultBal * priceDiff * 1e6) / (PRECISION * totalCdsDepositedAmount)`, and updates `lastEthPrice` after performing calculations.

During price movements, this creates a disproportionate impact on value calculations because the fixed scaling factor does not adjust relative to price magnitudes. For example, a price movement from $2000 to $2500 (25% increase) gets calculated using the raw difference of $500 multiplied by the fixed constant, rather than being properly scaled as a percentage change. This means larger absolute price movements create increasingly distorted value calculations.

When the market experiences significant price volatility, attackers can front-run price updates with strategic deposits, allowing their positions to be valued using the distorted calculation. They can then extract excess value based on this artificial inflation and exit before the system corrects itself. This exploitation path becomes more lucrative as the price movement magnitude increases.

The impact scales with both the size of price movements and the total vault balance, creating a systemic risk where large price swings can lead to significant value extraction from the protocol and permanent damage to its economic security model.

## Proof of Concept
An attacker exploits the cumulative value calculation during high ETH price volatility:

Given:
- Initial ETH price = $2000
- New ETH price = $2500
- Vault balance = 10,000 ETH
- Attacker deposit = 100,000 USDa
- `_amount = 1000` (fixed constant)
- `PRECISION = 1e12`

Original Calculation:
```solidity
priceDiff = $2500 - $2000 = $500
value = (_amount * vaultBal * priceDiff * 1e6) / (PRECISION * totalCdsDepositedAmount)
value = (1000 * 10000 * 500 * 1e6) / (1e12 * 100000)
value = 50,000,000,000 / 1e17
```

This artificially high value means attacker can extract:
- Extra reward = (~50 ETH worth of value)
- When should only get: (500/2000) * 100,000 = 25 ETH worth of price appreciation

The fixed scaling of 1000 creates a 2x inflation of rewards during this price movement.

## Recommended mitigation steps
```solidity
function calculateCumulativeValue(
    uint128 currentPrice,
    uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
    uint128 lastEthPrice,
    uint256 vaultBal
) public pure returns (CDSInterface.CalculateValueResult memory) {
    if (totalCdsDepositedAmount == 0 || currentPrice == 0 || lastEthPrice == 0) {
        return CDSInterface.CalculateValueResult(0, true);
    }

    // Use higher precision for intermediate calculations
    uint256 constant CALC_PRECISION = 1e18;
    
    uint256 priceRatio;
    bool gains;
    
    // Safe multiplication before division
    if (currentPrice > lastEthPrice) {
        priceRatio = (uint256(currentPrice) * CALC_PRECISION).divRoundDown(lastEthPrice);
        gains = true;
    } else {
        priceRatio = (uint256(lastEthPrice) * CALC_PRECISION).divRoundDown(currentPrice);
        gains = false;
    }
    
    // Preserve precision in multiplication sequence
    uint256 value = vaultBal.mulDivRoundDown(
        priceRatio - CALC_PRECISION,
        CALC_PRECISION
    );

    require(value <= type(uint128).max, "Value overflow");
    return CDSInterface.CalculateValueResult(uint128(value), gains);
}
```

The fix replaces the problematic fixed scaling approach with a percentage-based calculation system that properly accounts for price movements at any magnitude. By making price state updates atomic with calculations and implementing proper scaling, the system becomes resistant to manipulation through price movement timing while maintaining accurate value assessment across all market conditions.
