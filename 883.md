# Missing Timelock Controls in CDS Liquidation Participation Rights

## Summary
The CDS contract's liquidation mechanism contains a critical security vulnerability that undermines its core risk management system. The issue stems from unprotected liquidation participation where users can opt into liquidations immediately upon deposit, without any time-based vesting or risk-adjusted share calculations.

While the contract implements withdrawal timelocks, it lacks corresponding controls for liquidation participation. This asymmetric security model allows attackers to bypass the protocol's intended risk distribution mechanism, effectively turning the insurance layer into a MEV opportunity.

The vulnerability isn't merely economic - it fundamentally compromises the protocol's ability to provide reliable insurance coverage, as attackers can capture liquidation proceeds without contributing to long-term risk coverage. This creates a systemic security risk where the protocol's core function as a risk management layer becomes unreliable.

## Proof of Concept
Initial Setup:
- Large CDP with 1000 ETH collateral at $2000/ETH ($2M total)
- Liquidation threshold at $1800/ETH
- Current CDS pool: 10 depositors, each with 100,000 USDT staked
- Total liquidation coverage: 1,000,000 USDT
- Share calculation: userLiquidationAmount / totalAvailableLiquidationAmount

Key Vulnerability:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L186

```solidity
struct CdsAccountDetails {
    uint64 depositedTime;      // Time of deposit
    uint128 liquidationAmount; // Amount allocated for liquidation
    bool optedLiquidation;     // Liquidation participation flag
}

function deposit(...) {
    if(liquidate) {
        // No time controls for liquidation participation
        cdsDetails[msg.sender].optedLiquidation = true;
        cdsDetails[msg.sender].liquidationAmount = liquidationAmount;
        totalAvailableLiquidationAmount += liquidationAmount;
    }
}
```

Attack Execution:
1. Monitor ETH price approaching $1800 threshold
2. Calculate optimal entry:
   ```solidity
   targetShare = 0.5; // 50% of liquidation proceeds
   requiredDeposit = totalAvailableLiquidationAmount * targetShare / (1 - targetShare);
   // With current pool: 1,000,000 * 0.5 / 0.5 = 1,000,000 USDT
   ```

3. Just before liquidation trigger:
   - Deposit 1,000,000 USDT
   - Set liquidationAmount = 1,000,000
   - Immediately eligible for 50% of liquidation proceeds

4. When liquidation executes:
   - Attacker receives: 500 ETH (worth $900,000 at liquidation price)
   - Original depositors: 50 ETH each (worth $90,000)
   - Guaranteed profit as share calculation is predictable

5. Exit position:
   - Sell ETH immediately at market
   - Withdraw USDT after timelock expires
   - No exposure to protocol risks despite claiming insurance proceeds

## Recommended mitigation steps
Implementation must address both timing and share calculation issues:

1. Add liquidation participation timelock:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public liquidationVestingStart;
uint256 constant MIN_VESTING_PERIOD = 7 days;

function deposit(...) {
    if(liquidate) {
        liquidationVestingStart[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
        require(liquidationAmount <= maxAllowedLiquidationAmount(), "Exceeds max share");
    }
}

function calculateVestedShare(address user) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 vestingTime = block.timestamp - liquidationVestingStart[user];
    if(vestingTime < MIN_VESTING_PERIOD) return 0;
    return Math.min(
        liquidationAmount * vestingTime / MAX_VESTING_PERIOD,
        liquidationAmount
    );
}
```

2. Progressive vesting of liquidation rights:
```solidity
struct VestingSchedule {
    uint256 startTime;
    uint256 fullVestingDuration;
    uint256 cliff;
    uint256 totalAmount;
}

function getVestedLiquidationShare(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    VestingSchedule memory schedule = vestingSchedules[user];
    if(block.timestamp < schedule.startTime + schedule.cliff) return 0;
    
    uint256 timeVested = block.timestamp - schedule.startTime;
    return Math.min(
        schedule.totalAmount * timeVested / schedule.fullVestingDuration,
        schedule.totalAmount
    );
}
```

3. Risk-adjusted share calculation:
```solidity
function calculateLiquidationShare(address user) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 vestedAmount = getVestedLiquidationShare(user);
    uint256 timeWeight = calculateTimeWeight(user);
    return (vestedAmount * timeWeight) / PRECISION;
}
```

These mitigations ensure liquidation participation aligns with the protocol's risk management objectives while preventing exploitation of the insurance mechanism.
