# CDS owners lose some profit from liquidation positions

### Summary

Missing update cds cumulative value in liquidation type1 will cause cds owners will lose some profit from the liquidation process.

### Root Cause

If one borrow position is liquidated, there will be some liquidation gain. The liquidation gain will include `Total Collateral of borrower + 20% Downside protected amount`.  the 20% downside protection given to user is provided by every dCDS user(https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/dcds).

In [liquidationType1()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L248), we will deduct the total cds deposit amount because of this liquidation. The deducted usda amount will be less than this liquidated position's total debt. Because cds owners will get back downside protected amount. That's the reason why we should add `cdsProfits` into the `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.

The problem is that we don't update the cds cumulative value. Each cds owner's withdraw amount will be calculated via the cds cumulative value. If we don't update this gain into the cumulative value, cds owners cannot withdraw this part of profit.

For example:
1. Alice deposits 1000 USDT/USDA into cds, does not opt in the liquidation in timestamp X.
2. Bob borrows 500 USDA in timestamp X.
3. Ether price drops, admin liquidates Bob's borrow position in timestamp X + 100.
4. Alice wants to withdraw her position in timestamp X + 100, the cumulative value for Alice will be negative value because of the ether price's drop. So Alice's withdraw amount will be less than (1000 + option fees). This is incorrect. After bob's liquidation, cds owners should gain downside protected amount to cover the loss in the cumulative value.
 
```solidity
    function liquidationType1(
        address user, // depositor
        uint64 index, // index
        uint64 currentEthPrice, // current ether price
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate // borrow rate.
    ) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits;
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 1000 USDT/USDA into cds, does not opt in the liquidation in timestamp X.
2. Bob borrows 500 USDA in timestamp X.
3. Ether price drops, admin liquidates Bob's borrow position in timestamp X + 100.
4. Alice wants to withdraw her position in timestamp X + 100, the cumulative value for Alice will be negative value because of the ether price's drop. So Alice's withdraw amount will be less than (1000 + option fees). This is incorrect. After bob's liquidation, cds owners should gain downside protected amount to cover the loss in the cumulative value.

### Impact

CDS owners will lose downside protected amount usda.

### Mitigation

In liquidation type1, we should update downside protected amount into the cumulative value.
