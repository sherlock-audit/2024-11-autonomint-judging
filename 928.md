# Incorrect `borrowingHealth` Calculation for Non-ETH Tokens

## Summary  
The [BorrowLib::withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L819-L800) function currently calculates `borrowingHealth` based on the ETH price, comparing the ETH price at the time of deposit to its current price. This calculation, however, is incorrect for tokens that are not ETH, such as weETH and wrsETH. For tokens other than ETH, `borrowingHealth` should be determined by their own respective exchange rates, reflecting their deposited value in relation to the current market value.  

The flawed approach leads to users being unable to withdraw their non-ETH tokens, even if these tokens maintain or appreciate in value on the market. The protocol incorrectly assumes that only a drop in ETH's price is relevant for the `borrowingHealth` calculation, negatively affecting users holding non-ETH tokens.  

## Root Cause  
The issue stems from the protocol's reliance on the ETH price to calculate `borrowingHealth` for all assets, ignoring the exchange rates and market performance of non-ETH tokens like weETH and wrsETH.  

## Internal Preconditions  
## External Preconditions  
- The price of ETH drops by more than 20% from the time of deposit.  
- Non-ETH tokens, such as weETH and wrsETH, either maintain a stable price or increase in value on the market.  

## Attack Path  
1. The price of ETH declines by more than 20% from the deposited value, while non-ETH tokens such as weETH and wrsETH either stay stable or rise in the market.  
2. When a user attempts to withdraw their non-ETH tokens, the `borrowingHealth` calculation incorrectly uses the ETH price drop without factoring in the exchange rates for these tokens.  
3. The protocol incorrectly calculates `borrowingHealth` as Low, blocking the withdrawal of non-ETH tokens, despite the actual market performance of those tokens.  

## Impact  
- **Withdrawal Issues for Non-ETH Tokens**: Users are unable to withdraw their non-ETH assets (such as weETH and wrsETH) even though these tokens may have stable or appreciating market values.  
- **Operational Disruptions**: This calculation flaw creates inconsistency in the protocol and damages user trust, potentially disrupting the protocol's operations.  
The `borrowLiquidation` functions [Type 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L190)and [Type 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L335-L336) are also affected by this issue.

## Mitigation  
To resolve this issue, the `borrowingHealth` calculation should be adjusted to use the respective exchange rates of non-ETH tokens, allowing for accurate value comparisons between the deposited and current market values of these assets.
