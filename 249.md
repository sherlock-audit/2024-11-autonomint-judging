# Logic flaw in `BorrowLib.sol::getOptionFeesTOPay`  allows users to bypass the `renewOption` deadline

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The `borrowing.sol::renewOption` passes the call to the [`BorrowLib.sol::renewOption`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L616), where certain confirmations are made about the eligibility of  the user to renew their options. 

Based on the architecture of the system, users should not be able to renew their options, under 15 days of creating them, or after 30 days of creating them. The snippet below shows the line of code that is suppose to enforce it.
[`BorrowLib.sol::getOptionFeesTOPay`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L445-L451)
```solidity
445         // check the user is eligible to renew position
446         if (
447             block.timestamp <
448             depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
449             block.timestamp >
450             depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
451         ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
The error here is that, it uses the && operator instead of the || operator. This error makes the check redundant as both coditions can never be met, hence there will never be a revert. Mathematically, it is like looking for a set of unkown `x` values, defined on the real number line such that x < 15 and also > 30. such values do not exist.

This breaks the core functionality of the function.
Also, due to solidity round down, for days much lesser than 15 days after the creation of the option, renew option fees will round close to zero, therefore, not only is the check being bypassed, the protocol gets no fees for all such renewals
```solidity
            uint256 secondsPassedSinceDeposit = block.timestamp - depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp;

            // calculate options fees per second
            uint128 optionsFeesPerSec = calculateOptionsFeesPerSec(depositDetail.optionFees);

            // calculate options fees needs to pay by multiplying timw difference and options fees per second
            //? i.e position will be renewed for 30 days from now. If 10 days have been passed since deposit,
            //? then the total validity for 80% LTV is 40 days from deposit
@>>         uint256 optionsFeesNeedsToPay = (optionsFeesPerSec * secondsPassedSinceDeposit) / OPTIONS_FEES_PRECISION;
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. This breaks the core functionality of the function
2. Close to zero fees are gotten from renewals relatively less than 15 days. Hence this is a bypass to evade fees on option renewals

### Mitigation

```diff
            if (
                block.timestamp <
-               depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
+               depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
                block.timestamp >
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
