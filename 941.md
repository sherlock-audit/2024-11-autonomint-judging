# ChainlinkOracle does not check if the returned price is outside the min/max range in MasterPriceOracle

### Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a built-in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset.

This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price, which will lead to draining of the protocol. This is exactly what happened to [Venus](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/), a lending protocol on BSC when LUNA imploded. However, the protocol missed to implement such a check.

Below is the ETH/USD price feed used by protocol return minAnswer on Optimism 

[ETH/USD minAnswer = 1000000000](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9#readContract)

### Root Cause

In [MasterPriceOracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83) it is not checking the minAnswer for the specific token, and reverting if that is what the oracle returned.
### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The price of the token drops below the minAnswer


### Attack Path

- Price of the token falls below the minAnswer
- Deposit the collateral token at the inflated price returned by chainlink (minAnswer)
- Borrow the maximum amount for an asset, the issue is that the borrowed amount will be worth more than the collateral, this causes bad debt for the protocol.

### Impact

Users will borrow an amount worth more than the collateral, this causes a huge fund loss and
Bad debt accumulation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

get the minPrice and maxPrice from the aggregator, then compare it to the price. revert if it is outside the bounds
```solidity
    require(answer >= minPrice && answer <= maxPrice, "invalid price");
  ```
