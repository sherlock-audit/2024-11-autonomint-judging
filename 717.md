# USDT Deposits in `CDS.deposit()` will revert due to .transferFrom() usage not returning any value for USDT

### Summary

The use of `transferFrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()` in CDSLib.sol's `deposit()` function will cause all USDT deposits to fail as USDT's non-standard implementation returns no value, causing the transaction check to revert.

### Root Cause

In [`CDSLib.sol:552`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L552-L582), the `deposit()` function uses unsafe USDT transfers:

```solidity
// Current implementation
bool usdtTransfer = interfaces.usdt.transferFrom(
  msg.sender,
  address(interfaces.treasury),
  params.usdtAmount
); // transfer amount to this contract
if (!usdtTransfer) revert CDSInterface.CDS_USDT_TransferFailed();
```
USDT's non-standard transferFrom() implementation doesn't return a boolean, making the success check always revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow` being below `usdtLimit`
2. User attempts to deposit USDT
3. User has approved contract for USDT transfer

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `CDS.deposit()` with USDT or and USDA
2. Function attempts USDT transfer
3. Transfer executes but returns no value
4. Boolean check fails
5. Transaction reverts

### Impact

Users cannot deposit USDT into the CDS Pool as deposit attempts will revert, effectively breaking a core protocol function.

### PoC

The function's failure path is described under the attack path.

### Mitigation

Replace current implementation with OpenZeppelin's `safeTransferFrom()`:

```solidity
import {SafeERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

// In contract:
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

// In deposit():
interfaces.usdt.safeTransferFrom(
    msg.sender,
    address(interfaces.treasury),
    amount
);
```
This handles non-standard ERC20 implementations safely.
