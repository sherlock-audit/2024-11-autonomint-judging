# `borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1()` fails for 100% LTV value

### Summary

`borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1()` [calculates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L143) the amount to return to abond as `(((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;`, where `returnToTreasury` is the debt paid. Whenever the LTV value is 100%, this will be 0, and any amount of accrued debt will make liquidations underflow.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLiq:143`, it underflows whenever LTV = 100% and debt accrued > 0 (all it takes is a bit of [interest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L205)).

### Internal pre-conditions

LTV is 100%.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidation type 1 is performed.

### Impact

1. Borrower can not be liquidated when LTV is 100%.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Consider the case when ltv is 100%, which is an expected value for the ltv.
