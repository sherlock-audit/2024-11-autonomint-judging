# anyone can make Borrowing.lastCumulativeRate huge

### Summary

lastEventTime is not updated in Borrowing.calculateCumulativeRate which can be triggered by anyone.

### Root Cause

calculateCumulativeRate is a public function, so anyone can call it. lastEventTime is not updated which means that lastCumulativeRate will be increased every time you call it.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }

    function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        // If there is no borrowers in the protocol
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            // current cumulative rate is same as ratePeSec
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Find time interval between last event and now
            uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            //calculate cumulative rate
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }

Debt of borrower is `depositDetail.normalizedAmount * cumulativeRate` which means noone will be able to repay there debt if cumulativeRate can arbitrary set to any value
### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

call multiple time `calculateCumulativeRate` until no one can repay their debt.

### Impact

Borrrowers will not be able to repay their debt, they will lose their deposited funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
update lastEventTime or make it private
