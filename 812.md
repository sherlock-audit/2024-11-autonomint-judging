# BorrowLib.sol#calculateReturnToAbond - Under some conditions, a higher value will be subtracted from a lower one, breaking the liquidation.

### Summary

On liquidation, part of the returned amount is returned to the abond. The function that calculates that has a wrong logic that leads  higher value will be subtracted from a lower one.

### Root Cause

In [calculateReturnToAbond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L137-L144) is calculated how much should be returned to the abond.
Let's look at the calculations:
```js
    function calculateReturnToAbond(uint128 depositedAmount, uint128 depositEthPrice, uint128 returnToTreasury)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint128)
    {
        return (((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;
    }

```
We will divide the formula into three parts to make the explanations easier:
- `((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100` -  this is the collateral for the deposited amount
- `returnToTreasury` - this is the user's debt 
- `10) / 100` - this gets 10% of the result which is not important now

Let's look at how `returnToTreasury` is calculated:
```js
        uint256 borrowerDebt = ((depositDetail.normalizedAmount * lastCumulativeRate) / BorrowLib.RATE_PRECISION);
        uint128 returnToTreasury = uint128(borrowerDebt);
```
The borrowed amount `normalizedAmount` is multiplied by the `lastCumulativeRate` meaning the debt will increase over time. 

If we return to the `calculateReturnToAbond`, we will see that the debt is subtracted from the collateral, meaning there is a high risk a higher value to be subtracted from a lower one causing a revert.
