# vault value is not being changed on liquidation

### Summary

there is no substraction `depositDetail.depositedAmountUsdValue` from vaultValue on liquidation like its done on borrower withdrawal

### Root Cause

Whenever borrower deposits there vault value increases:
```solidity
            // find current vault value by adding current depositing amount
            currentVaultValue = previousData.vaultValue + (amount * currentEthPrice);
            previousData.vaultValue = currentVaultValue;
```

Whenever borrower withdraw there vault value decreases:

```solidity
            omniChainData.vaultValue -= depositDetail.depositedAmountUsdValue;
```

But when borrowers get liquidated vault value doesn't change. Why is it important? Cds holder's ability to withdraw depends on it, if its not accounting correctly they will not be able to withdraw here:
```solidity
        if (withdrawResult.omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei != 0) {
            if (borrowing.calculateRatio(0, ethPrice) < (2 * CDSLib.RATIO_PRECISION)) revert CDS_NotEnoughFundInCDS();
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

always happens on liquidations

### Impact

CDS holders will not be able to withdraw when they should because the system thinks there are more borrowers than there actually are. Their funds will be stuck. They will be forced to protect borrower collateral that doesn't exist anymore

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update value on liquidation
```diff
        omniChainData.totalInterestFromLiquidation += uint256(borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount);
        omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei -= depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH;
        omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinUSD -= depositDetail.depositedAmountUsdValue;
        omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountLiquidatedInWei += depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH;
+        omniChainData.vaultValue -= depositDetail.depositedAmountUsdValue;

```
