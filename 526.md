# 10% of CDS depositors profit are stuck in the treasury during withdrawal without a way to retrieve them

### Summary

During withdrawal from the CDS, 10% of the USDa profit of the user are sent to the treasury. However there is no way to withdraw these funds from the treasury and as such they are stuck forever.

### Root Cause



```solidity
File: CDS.sol
334:     @>    uint256 optionFees = ((cdsDepositDetails.normalizedAmount * omniChainData.lastCumulativeRate) /
335:             (CDSLib.PRECISION * CDSLib.NORM_PRECISION)) - cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount;

343:         uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn( // @audit-info value to return (i.e depositedAmount ± profit)
344:             msg.sender,
345:             index,
346:             omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
347:             omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
348:             excessProfitCumulativeValue
349:         ) - 1; //? subtracted extra 1 wei
350: 
351:         cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = currentValue;
352:         uint256 returnAmount = cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount + optionFees;
353:   @>    cdsDepositDetails.withdrawedAmount = returnAmount;


```

- `currentValue` is the user's `depositedAmount ± profit` and
- `returnAmount` is the `depositedAmount ± profit + optionFees` which is now the `cdsDepositDetails.withdrawedAmount`

`params.usdaToTransfer` is the amount of USDa that is finally transferred to the user but not all the `cdsDepositDetails.withdrawedAmount` above is transferred because 10% of this amount is transferred to the `treasury` and recorded as `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` by calling `updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw()`

```solidity
File: CDSLib.sol
800:                 //Calculate the usda amount to give to user after deducting 10% from the above final amount @audit HIGH: the remaining 10% is stuck in the treasury!
801:                 params.usdaToTransfer = calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, returnAmountWithGains);
802:                 //Update the treasury data
803:    @>           interfaces.treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(returnAmountWithGains - params.usdaToTransfer);



File: Treasury.sol
493:     function updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(
494:         uint256 amount
495:     ) external onlyCoreContracts {
496:   @>    usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw += amount;
497:     }

```

The problem is that unfortunately, this amount is never removed from the treasury by any means or used anywhere.

### Impact

10% of profit during withdrawa are stuck in the treasury forever

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a function to withdraw this `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` from the treasury or better still account for it elsewhere.
