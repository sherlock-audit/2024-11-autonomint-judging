# `liquidationType2` will self DOS due to lack of ETH

### Summary


ETH is not pulled from the treasury to turn into sUSD. 
Although it's in a payable function, the ETH is inside the treasury contract and admin doesn't have access directly to take ETH out and send via `msg.value`, it has to be pulled internally from treasury when calling liquidation


### Root Cause


lack of ETH movement from treasury into borrowLiquidation contract. So, [borrowLiquidation.liquidationType2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L340-L354) will fail.

### Attack Path


When liquidating type 2, the Eth in value is turned into WETH, and then ot is turned into sETH from synthetix.
Then the sETH is turned into sUSD and this amount is used to liquidate.

But the issue is `liquidationType2` on `BorrowLiqudiation` contract lacks the ETH in it. Although its in a payable function, the ETH is inside the treasury contract and admin doesn't have access directly to take ETH out and send via `msg.value`, it has to be pulled from treasury and continue the steps to swap into `sUSD`.

```solidity

    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {

        uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);
        // Convert the ETH into WETH
    @>  weth.deposit{value: amount}();
        // Approve it, to mint sETH
        bool approved = weth.approve(address(wrapper), amount);
        if (!approved) revert BorrowLiq_ApproveFailed();

        // Mint sETH
        wrapper.mint(amount);
        // Exchange sETH with sUSD
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,

        );

        // Calculate the margin
        int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        // Transfer the margin to synthetix
        synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);

        // Submit an offchain delayed order in synthetix for short position with 1X leverage
        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
            -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
            currentEthPrice * 1e16
        );
    }
```

### Impact


`liquidationType2` is DOS, broken functionality

### Mitigation


move ETH from the treasury to BorrowLiquidation
