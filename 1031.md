# Health ratio is hardcoded causing issues once the LTV is updated

### Summary

The current LTV of the protocol is 80% and is intended to increase as much as possible once the protocol matures (as stated in the docs). The issue is that the health ratio of borrow positions is hardcoded in several places causing issues once the LTV is actually updated.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib and in borrowLiquidation the health ratio of a position is hardcoded to 8000 = 80%. This is because the initial LTV of a deposit will be 80%. The health ratio is used to make sure that a withdrawer cannot withdraw their collateral if they are eligible for liquidation and more importantly to determine whether a borrower can be liquidated. The issue is that the LTV is intended to grow, therefore if the LTV grows for example to 90%, a hardcoded health ratio of only 80% will be insufficient.

### Attack Path

1. After some time the LTV is increased to 90%, thus the debt of borrowers will be worth 90% of their collateral.
2. However, as the health ratio is hardcoded to 80%, the only way for a borrower to be liquidated is if their collateral decreases it's value by 20%, instead of 10%.
3. Therefore, debt positions will always be heavily insolvent before they can be liquidated, increasing the risks of bad debt accruing to the protocol.

### Impact

Once the LTV is increased, the health ratio will remain the same, causing debt positions to not be liquidatable even when they are insolvent, accruing bad debt to the protocol.

### Mitigation

The health ratio should be modifiable in order to account for the increasing LTV.
