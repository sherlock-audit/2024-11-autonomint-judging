# Potential Underflow in `withdrawInterest`

### Summary

In the `withdrawInterest` function, if `totalInterest` is less than `amount`, subtracting `amount` from `totalInterest` will cause an underflow and revert the transaction due to Solidity 0.8.x's checked arithmetic, even if `totalInterestFromLiquidation` has sufficient balance to cover the withdrawal.

### Root Cause

The function checks the combined balance but only subtracts from `totalInterest`:

```solidity
require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation), "Treasury don't have enough interest");
totalInterest -= amount;
```

If `totalInterest < amount`, this subtraction underflows and reverts.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

DOS, underflow and revert.

### PoC

1. Set `totalInterest` to 50 and `totalInterestFromLiquidation` to 100.
2. Attempt to withdraw an `amount` of 75.
3. The `require` passes because 75 â‰¤ 150.
4. Subtracting 75 from `totalInterest` (50) causes an underflow and reverts.

### Mitigation

Implement logic to deduct the `amount` from `totalInterest` and `totalInterestFromLiquidation` proportionally or sequentially:

```solidity
if (amount <= totalInterest) {
    totalInterest -= amount;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = amount - totalInterest;
    totalInterest = 0;
    totalInterestFromLiquidation -= remaining;
}
```
