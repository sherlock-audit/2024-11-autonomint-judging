# `liquidationType2` only works with ETH deposits

### Summary

`liquidationType2` liquidates a deposit by transferring half of its collateral to Synthethix. The issue is that it currently does not support weETH and wrsETH deposits.

### Root Cause

In borrowLiquidation.liquidationType2 the liquidated collateral is directly deposited into WETH. This is problematic as weETH and wrsETH collaterals cannot be directly deposited into WETH, they must first be converted to ETH. As a result, the call will either fail due to lack of funds or the deposited collateral into WETH will be taken out of other users' deposits that have used ETH as collateral.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user that has deposited weETH is liquidated through `liquidationType2`.
2. Half of the collateral is attempted to be deposited into WETH, however, as it is not first converted to ETH, the call fails due to a lack of ETH in the contract.

### Impact

`liquidationType2` is likely to revert if it liquidates weETH/wrsETH collateral. Furthermore, collateral from other users that have deposited ETH may be used to complete the liquidation.

### Mitigation

Consider converting the weETH/wrsETH into ETH before depositing them to Synthethix.
