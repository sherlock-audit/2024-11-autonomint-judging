# Setting wrong fill price for synthetix position when doing a liquidation type 2

### Summary
sETH price differs from ETH which will create issues during the creation of synthetix position, as we set it for the fill price.

### Root Cause

Feeds:
- https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/seth/
- https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/

At the time of this submission `sETH` is lower than `ETH`, and historically also seems this to be the case, with 3-8% difference.

```solidity
        // Exchange sETH with sUSD
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );

        // Calculate the margin
       int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        // Transfer the margin to synthetix
        synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);

        // Submit an offchain delayed order in synthetix for short position with 1X leverage
@>>        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
            -int256((uint256(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)), currentEthPrice * 1e16
        );
```
Root cause is that we set the wrong fill price as  `currentEthPrice * 1e16`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
1. Attempting to execute `LiquidationType2`.
2. When submitting the order on the Perps DEX via `submitOffchainDelayedOrder()`, the fill price is set as `currentEthPrice * 1e16`. However, if no significant volatility occurs, this price might not be reached for a long time, preventing the order from being executed.
3. Orders are executed by the admin using:
```solidity
   function executeOrdersInSynthetix(bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData) external onlyBorrowingContract {
       // Execute the submitted order
       synthetixPerpsV2.executeOffchainDelayedOrder{value: 1}(address(this), priceUpdateData);
   }
```
The priceUpdateData parameter contains an off-chain signed price for sETH. However, for the order to be executed, the fill price must be reached.
4. Since the sETH price differs from the ETH price, the order-fill requirement is: `Market Price â‰¥ Fill Price`. This discrepancy can stop the order from being executed.

### Impact
- Liquidations should be available non-stop. The current logic could DoS and make the liquidation type2 unavailable.

### Mitigation
Use the feed for sETH instead of ETH.
