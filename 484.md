# The owner cannot withdraw the interest from liquidation.


### Summary

The underflow in [`Treasury.sol#withdrawInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L616-L625) will cause a revert for the owner to withdraw interest from liquidation as the function does not handle the case where `amount > totalInterest`.

### Root Cause

- In `Treasury.sol#withdrawInterest()`, there can be underflow for withdrawing the interest from liquidation.

```solidity
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
--->    require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
--->    totalInterest -= amount;
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```

From `Treasury.sol#withdrawInterest():L622`, we can see withdrawable amount is `totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation`. But if `amount > totalInterest`, `L622` is reverted.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to call `withdrawInterest` to set `amount` to be more than `totalInterest`.

### External pre-conditions

1. `totalInterest` needs to be less than the `amount` requested for withdrawal.

### Attack Path

1. Owner calls `withdrawInterest` with an `amount` greater than `totalInterest`.

### Impact

The owner cannot withdraw the interest of liquidation from treasury.

### Mitigation

`Treasury.sol#withdrawInterest()` function has to be modified as follows.

```solidity
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
        require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
--      totalInterest -= amount;
++      if(amount <= totalInterest) {
++          totalInterest -= amount;
++      } else {
++          totalInterestFromLiquidation -= (amount - totalInterest);
++          totalInterest = 0;
++      }
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```
