# A malicious borrower can make their position immune to `Liquidationtype1`

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause
Me: ðŸ¤”
> During borrow liquidation who do you send the msg.value to if the liquidationAmount from other chains is zero. 
Do you intend to send Eth back to the liquidator or the user being liquidated 

Sponsor: ðŸ¤“
> liquidator i.e admin

As confirmed with the sponsors in a private thread during the contest, the msg.value sent along with the `BorrowLiquidation::liquidateBorrowPosition`, is intended to be sent back to the transaction originator, which is the liquidator. However there has been an oversight in the implementation of this logic, and the `msg.value` has been been erroneously sent to the user that is being liquidated.

```solidity
    function liquidationType1(
@>>     address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        // Check whether the position is already liquidated or not
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");
        //Skip Implementation............
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
@>>        (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        //Skip implementation.......
```

A malicious user can set a malicious payable fallback to ensure that there is always a revert whenever there is an attempt to liquidate them, hence making their position immune to `liquidationType1`.
