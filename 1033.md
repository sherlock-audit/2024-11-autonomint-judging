# Arithmetic Underflow Risk in Liquidation Type 1 Due to Uncapped Debt Growth

### Summary

A critical arithmetic vulnerability exists in the `liquidationType1` function where underflow reverts can occur in two distinct locations. This issue manifests when a borrower's accumulated debt (including interest) surpasses their initially deposited collateral value, making liquidation impossible.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the unchecked growth of `borrowerDebt` over time, which can exceed the initial collateral amount deposited by borrower.

This is due to the cumulative rate calculation to calculate debt not being capped at the deposited collateral amount. 

In `borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1` borrower's total debt with intrest is calculated, which is then set to `uint128 returnToTreasury`

```solidity
        uint256 borrowerDebt = ((depositDetail.normalizedAmount * lastCumulativeRate) / BorrowLib.RATE_PRECISION);
        uint128 returnToTreasury = uint128(borrowerDebt);
```

So now if this amount `returnToTreasury` comes bigger than amount of collateral deposited by borrower at the time of deposit, ie. `depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit` then this will cause underflow revert in two instances:

1. first instance of underflow revert is in calculating [BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L209): 

```solidity
@->        uint128 returnToAbond = BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond(
            depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, returnToTreasury
        );
```  

Revert here in [calculations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L143) 
because value of `returnToTreasury` is bigger than value of `(((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100)` so when this subtraction will happen it will revert!  

```solidity
    function calculateReturnToAbond(uint128 depositedAmount, uint128 depositEthPrice, uint128 returnToTreasury)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint128)
    {
@->>       return (((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;
    }
```

2. Second instance of underflow revert is in calculating [cdsProfits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L212) 
we can clearly see here value of this `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100)` is going to lesser than `returnToTreasury` & ` returnToAbond` as they both are combined going to be subtracted from that.
So here also underflow revert will happen.

```solidity
        uint128 cdsProfits = (
            ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury - returnToAbond;
```


### Internal pre-conditions

The vulnerability becomes active when a borrower's accumulated debt exceeds their initial collateral value.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

This scenario creates a mathematical impossibility in the liquidation calculations, preventing the execution of necessary protocol safety measures.


### Impact

1. Liquidation Failure: The protocol becomes unable to execute liquidations when needed most
2. Protocol Risk: Accumulation of bad debt becomes inevitable
3. Economic Impact: CDS participants lose potential liquidation profits
4. Systemic Risk: Creates a perverse incentive for borrowers to intentionally exceed collateral value

### PoC

Revert here in calculation -> 

- example - (((((1e18 * 1000e2) / 1e12) / 100) - 1200e6) * 10) / 100
 
Where `(((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100)` is deposited amount at the time of deposit = 1000e6
and where accured total debt `returnToTreasury` = 1200e6  

(((((1e18 * 1000e2) / 1e12) / 100) - 1200e6) * 10) / 100 => Underfolow REVERT!

```solidity
    function calculateReturnToAbond(uint128 depositedAmount, uint128 depositEthPrice, uint128 returnToTreasury)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint128)
    {
@->        return (((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;
    }
```

### Mitigation

Implement a proactive liquidation mechanism that triggers before the total debt can exceed the collateral value. This should include regular monitoring of debt-to-collateral ratios and automated liquidation triggers at predetermined thresholds.
