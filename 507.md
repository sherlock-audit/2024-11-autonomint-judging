# `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq()` retains part of the accrued usdA reward, but it can't be claimed

### Summary

`withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq()` is used for CDS holders that didn't participate in the liquidate functionality, to get their usdA back.

Inside it, we calculate the usdA to get back (principal usdA + rewards) and calculate 10% of the rewards [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L205-L217) to be retained in `Treasury.sol` (when we deposit initially in CDS, we send the deposited usdA in `Treasury.sol`).

But nowhere in the `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq()` I see a function that updates usdA such as `updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw()` which is called in the withdraw process if liquidation process was set to true.

This means that the user will correctly receive principal + 90% of the rewards accrued, but the treasury contract won't have the value increment due to not calling `updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw()`, thus losing on fees.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that in withholding 10% of rewards from the withdraw that should have been accounted for in the `Treasury.sol`, the function does nothing as of now in `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq()` in comparison to the withdrawal when the user has opted for liquidation gains - we can see it is being accounted [there](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L803), thus causing funds to be stucked if the user has not opted for liquidation gains as the 10% of the usdA is nowhere accounted for.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `cds::deposit()` and doesn't opt for participating in the liquidation gains and deposits 1000 usdA
2. User calls `cds::withdraw()` and gets his initial deposit + 90% of the rewards accrued, but the 10% that remained in the `Treasury.sol` are not accounted in `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq()` in comparison to the withdrawal logic that is for opted liquidations gains as I mentioned in the root cause section

### Impact

Treasury hasn't accounted those 10% of the rewards that were given by the user when withdrawing, thus losing on fees every single time a withdrawal process (not opted for liq.) is done, resulting in protocol losing fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the `interface.treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw()` in the `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq()` placing in the params the 10% of the rewards, so the `Treasury.sol` correctly tracks and accounts for the fees that it gets.
