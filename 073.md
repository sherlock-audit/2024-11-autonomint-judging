# revenue earned from user withdrawal will be forever lost

### Summary

protocol will never be able to claim usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw 

### Root Cause

There is a 10% tax on all user's profit withdrawal, but protocol never claims/withdraw it 

```solidity
                params.usdaToTransfer = calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, returnAmountWithGains);
                //Update the treasury data
                interfaces.treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(returnAmountWithGains - params.usdaToTransfer);

...

    function calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(
        uint256 depositedAmount,
        uint256 returnAmount
    ) public pure returns (uint128) {
        uint256 toUser;
        // if the return amount is greater than depsoited amount,
        // deduct 10% from it
        if (returnAmount > depositedAmount) {
            uint256 profit = returnAmount - depositedAmount;
            toUser = returnAmount - (profit * 10) / 100;
        } else {
            toUser = returnAmount;
        }

        return uint128(toUser);
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

always happening

### Impact

10% of all cds users withdrawals profits will be lost

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

fix it, totalInterest needs to be updated to claim it
```diff
    function updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
-        usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw += amount;
+        totalInterest += amount;
    }
```
