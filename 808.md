# `BorrowLiquidation` contract will incorrectly send the remaining ETH to the borrower after liquidation

### Summary

BorrowLiquidation::liquidationType1 function sends the remaining ETH to the borrower instead of the liquidator after liquidation resulting in loss of fund for the liquidator.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLiquidation.sol:303` the remaining ETH is sent to the borrower (`user`) instead of the liquidator (`tx.origin`) (who originally started the liquidation from Borrowing contract).

### Internal pre-conditions

1.  Liquidation is of type 1
2. `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` needs to be equal to `0` in `BorrowLiquidation::liquidationType1`

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The liquidator (Admin) calls `Borrowing::liquidate` with ETH to liquidate a borrower's position.
2. The borrowing contract calls `liquidateBorrowPosition` to liquidate the borrower's position.
3.  For liquidation of Type 1, `liquidationType1` is called to handle the liquidation.
4. `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` is found to be equal to `0`
5.  The borrower's position is liquidated and the remaining ETH is incorrectly sent to the borrower (`user`) instead of being returned to the liquidator.

### Impact

The liquidator does not receive the remaining ETH they provided for the liquidation. The borrower incorrectly receives the ETH.

### PoC

At [BorrowLiquidation.sol:303](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L303) The function clearly sends the remaining ETH to the `user` address which correspond to the the liquidated borrower address instead of returning them to the liquidator:

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Liquidate the position by using CDS
 * @param user Borrower's address
 * @param index Liquidating index
 * @param currentEthPrice current ETH price
 * @param lastCumulativeRate last cumulative rate
 */
function liquidationType1(
    address user,
    uint64 index,
    uint64 currentEthPrice,
    uint256 lastCumulativeRate
) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
    ...
    if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
        (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
    ...
}
```

### Mitigation

In `BorrowLiquidation.sol:303` change `payable(user).call{value: msg.value}` to `payable(tx.origin).call{value: msg.value}` where `tx.origin` will represent the original caller of `Borrowing::liquidate` function.
