# Excess native token sent in `borrowing.sol::renewOptions` is not refunded and can be stolen by other users

### Attack Path

To renew options, users are required to send an amount of native token along with the transaction, to cover for fees. This fee amount is dynamic and can change from time to time. The issue is that certain transactions might be excuted before the caller's execution and might have reduced the fee amount by some value. The function uses only the `fee.nativeFee` and ignores the excess that might have been sent along by the caller of the function. Such excess funds in the contracts continues to accumulate, as there is no direct means of removing them.

```solidity
        // calculting fee for lz send transaction
@>>     MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositDetail.assetName,
            _options,
            false
        );

        // Calling Omnichain send function
@>>     globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositDetail.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        )
```
This vulnerability can be leveraged upon by another user, to steal all such excess amount left in the contract.  This other issue arises because in the `BorrowLib::deposit` function there is no such confirmation that `params.depositingAmount = msg.value`, whenever the user is depositing a native token. Follow the snippet bellow
```solidity
    function deposit(
        IBorrowing.BorrowLibDeposit_Params memory libParams,
        IBorrowing.BorrowDepositParams memory params,
        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        mapping(IBorrowing.AssetName => address assetAddress) storage assetAddress
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 depositingAmount = params.depositingAmount
        //Skip Imlementation....
        if (params.assetName != IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
            bool sent = IERC20(assetAddress[params.assetName]).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(interfaces.treasury), depositingAmount);
            if (!sent) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_USDaTransferFailed();
        }
        //Call the deposit function in Treasury contract
        //@audit there is no confirmation if msg.value = depositingamount
        //@audit an attacker can steal excess native tokens for themselves since there is no validation for msg.value
        //currently here
@>>     ITreasury.DepositResult memory depositResult = interfaces.treasury.deposit{
            value: params.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? params.depositingAmount : 0
        }(
            msg.sender,
            libParams.ethPrice,
            uint64(block.timestamp),
            params.assetName,
            params.depositingAmount
        );
```
This function takes `depositingAmount` from the available amount sitting in the contract and deposit it on behalf of the user. 

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always confirm that `params.depositingAmount => msg.value`
Refund all excess ETH in every payable function.
