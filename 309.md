# Missing checks for whether the L2 Sequencer is active

## Summary
Chainlink advises users relying on price oracles to monitor the status of the L2 Sequencer such as for Optimism [(+)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds). In situations where the sequencer becomes inactive, Chainlink oracles might reflect outdated prices from the period prior to the downtime, until a new L2 OCR transaction is processed.

## Impact
Users who conduct transactions via the L1 Delayed Inbox could exploit these outdated prices.

## Tools Used
manual review

## Recommendations
As chainlink suggests [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds), To prevent this, implement a Chainlink oracle to identify when the sequencer is offline and prohibit transactions during these periods of inactivity.
