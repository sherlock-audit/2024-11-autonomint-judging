# Lack of check allows borrowers to purchase options that never expire

### Summary

When borrowers deposit collateral, they also purchase a call options that gives them price exposure to ETH price increases above a certain strike price.

An expiration date is critical to the pricing of an option because it confines risk exposure to option sellers and allows for accurate pricing of option fees.

Autonomint keeps track of when the option is purchased using the `optionsRenewedTimeStamp` and alludes to the expiration date being 30 days from the `optionsRenewedTimeStamp`:

Autonomint also provides a function to renew options:
```solidity
function renewOptions(uint64 index) external payable {
        if (
            !BorrowLib.renewOptions(
                Interfaces(
                    treasury,
                    globalVariables,
                    usda,
                    abond,
                    cds,
                    options
                ),
                index
            )
        ) revert Borrow_RenewFailed();
```

However, thereâ€™s no check that enforces an option expiration date, which allows borrowers to purchase options that never expire. 

### Root Cause

When a borrower calls `Borrowing::withDraw()`, `BorrowLib::calculateCollateralToReturn()` calls `Options::calculateStrikePriceGains()` to determine if the user should get paid out for the option, and if they are, how much to pay out.

This logic has a missing check, allowing borrowers to exercise their options anytime.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A borrower calls `Borrowing::depositTokens()` purchasing a call option.

### External pre-conditions

1. The price of ETH increases to above the borrowers strike price

### Attack Path

1. A malicious borrower deposits collateral when the ETH price is $1000 and purchases a call options with a strike price of $1250.
2. The borrower knows that they just purchased an options that won't expire, so they don't withdraw until the price of ETH exceeds the strike price.
3. Say the price of ETH hits $1500 afetr 2 years. The borrower calls `Borrowing::withDraw()` and receives from the call option he purchased.

### Impact

Loss of funds for the dCDS depositors since they are technically the option sellers. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check that only let's borrowers exercise their options within a certain timeframe.
