# Inability to Withdraw Interest from `totalInterestFromLiquidation`

### Summary

The [`withdrawInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L616) function is designed to allow the owner to withdraw interest accrued in the treasury. However, the function logic only deducts the withdrawal amount from totalInterest:
```javascript
require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
totalInterest -= amount;
 ```
Even if we check that amount that is bigget than `totalIntrest` will go through the require check, but the following line revet, This prevents the protocol from correctly deducting from totalInterestFromLiquidation when the withdrawal amount exceeds totalInterest. As a result, interest accumulated through liquidations remains inaccessible, even though it is included in the withdrawal check.

### Root Cause

The withdrawal check considers both totalInterest and totalInterestFromLiquidation:

```javascript
require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation), "Treasury don't have enough interest");
```
However, the deduction only updates totalInterest:

```javascript
totalInterest -= amount;
```
No mechanism exists to deduct from totalInterestFromLiquidation when the withdrawal amount exceeds totalInterest.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Lock of funds: The owner cannot withdraw interest accumulated through liquidations, even though it is included in the available balance.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the withdraw logic:
```javascript
if (amount > totalInterest) {
    uint256 remainingAmount = amount - totalInterest;
    totalInterest = 0;
    totalInterestFromLiquidation -= remainingAmount;
} else {
    totalInterest -= amount;
}
```
