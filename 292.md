# Wrong userState is affected in transferFrom function

### Summary

The `transferFrom()` function in the Abond Token is [updating](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L165) the `msg.sender` userStates  with the state of the `from` user. But should update the `from` account instead. 

The logic of the State may be broken which could lead to problems when states is using for example [redeeming the yield](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L990) or withdrawing from [Ionic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L710).

### Root Cause

The issue here is that the fromState is calculates based on the `from` account but than the `userStates` updates for the `msg.sender` 
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        // check the input params are non zero
        require(from != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User");

        // get the sender and receiver state
        State memory fromState = userStates[from];
        State memory toState = userStates[to];

        // update receiver state
        toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value));
        userStates[to] = toState;

        // update sender state
        fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
        userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;

        // transfer abond
        super.transferFrom(from, to, value);
        return true;
    }
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In case when user A will get an approve from user B and transfer Abond tokens from user's A account than the State of user A will be replaced by the state of the user B. It may create a problem for user A because now all info is overridden.

```solidity
struct State {
    uint256 cumulativeRate;
    uint128 ethBacked;
    uint128 aBondBalance;
}
```

So user may be unable to redeem his yield because of this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L992).

### Mitigation

Consider updating the state for the `from` account instead of the `msg.sender`.
