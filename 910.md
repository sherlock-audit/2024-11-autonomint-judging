# transferFrom Function Allows Potential Loss of Funds

### Summary

The transferFrom function is used instead of safeTransferFrom, which can lead to potential loss of funds if the transfer fails. The transferFrom function does not revert the transaction on failure, which can cause unexpected behavior and financial losses.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom. The transferFrom function does not revert the transaction if the transfer fails, whereas safeTransferFrom ensures that the transaction reverts on failure, providing a safer mechanism for transferring tokens.

```solidity
if (params.usdtAmount != 0 && params.usdaAmount != 0) {
            if (interfaces.usdt.balanceOf(msg.sender) < params.usdtAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_Insufficient_USDT_Balance(); // check if user has sufficient USDa token
            bool usdtTransfer = interfaces.usdt.transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(interfaces.treasury),
                params.usdtAmount
            ); // transfer amount to this contract
            if (!usdtTransfer) revert CDSInterface.CDS_USDT_TransferFailed();
            //Transfer USDa tokens from msg.sender to this contract
            bool usdaTransfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
```

### Internal pre-conditions

-intended transfer fails in which it might not return an error

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

might lead to loss for protocol as transaction might fail silently.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement safeTransfer lib to transfer tokens
