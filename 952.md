# Incorrect Calculation of `borrowingHealth` in `BorrowLib::withdraw` for assets other than ETH.

### Summary

The `BorrowLib::withdraw` function calculates `borrowingHealth` as the ratio of the ETH price at the time of deposit to its current price in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L819). This approach is incorrect for tokens other than ETH, such as weETH and wrsETH. For non-ETH tokens, `borrowingHealth` should be calculated using their respective exchange rates, comparing their deposited value to their current value in the market.  

Due to this flawed calculation, users might be prevented from withdrawing their assets even if these tokens maintain a stable or increasing price in the market. This is because the protocol only considers the drop in ETH's price, which unfairly impacts the `borrowingHealth` calculation for non-ETH tokens.  

### Root Cause

The protocol calculates `borrowingHealth` based solely on the ETH price, disregarding the exchange rates and market performance of non-ETH tokens like weETH and wrsETH.  


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The price of ETH decreases by more than 20% from its deposited value.  
- The price of non-ETH tokens like weETH and wrsETH either remains constant or increases in the market. 

### Attack Path

1. The price of ETH decreases by more than 20% from its deposited value, while non-ETH tokens such as weETH and wrsETH maintain stable or rising prices.  
2. When a user attempts to withdraw their non-ETH tokens, the `borrowingHealth` calculation fails to account for the respective exchange rates of these assets.  
3. Due to the reliance on the ETH price drop, the protocol incorrectly marks the `borrowingHealth` as Low, blocking the withdrawal of non-ETH assets.  

### Impact

- **Users Unable to Withdraw Non-ETH Tokens**: Even when non-ETH tokens like weETH and wrsETH maintain good market performance, users are prevented from withdrawing these assets due to a low `borrowingHealth` value influenced solely by ETH price changes.  
- **Disruption to Protocol Operations**: The flawed calculation introduces inconsistencies and creates a negative user experience, potentially damaging trust in the protocol.

### Mitigation

use respective exchange rates to calculate borrowingHealth for non-ETH tokens
