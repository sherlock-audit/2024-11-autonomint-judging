# Arbitrary price manipulation in `redeemUSDT` function enables treasury drain

### Summary

The `redeemUSDT` function in the `CDS` contract uses `usdtPrice` and `usdaPrice` values provided by the user to calculate the amount of USDT tokens to transfer from the Treasury. This lack of validation allows an attacker to input manipulated prices, leading to an excessive transfer of USDT for a minimal amount of USDa. This vulnerability can be exploited to drain USDT tokens from the Treasury.

### Root Cause

- The `redeemUSDT` function accepts `usdtPrice` and `usdaPrice` as user inputs without validating their accuracy against a trusted price feed.

- The calculation for `usdtAmount` relies on these user-provided prices:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L404

  ```solidity
  uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
  ```
- Since `usdtPrice` can be manipulated by the user, an attacker can provide an artificially low `usdtPrice` and a minimal `usdaAmount` to withdraw disproportionately large amounts of USDT from the Treasury.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. The attacker provides an extremely low `usdtPrice` and a small `usdaAmount` when calling `redeemUSDT`.
2. The calculation:
   ```solidity
   uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
   ```
   results in a large `usdtAmount`.
3. The attacker receives a significant amount of USDT while burning only a small amount of USDa.  
4. The attacker repeats this process, draining USDT from the Treasury.

### Impact

- **Treasury Drain**: An attacker can repeatedly exploit this vulnerability to deplete the Treasury's USDT reserves.  
- **Protocol Collapse**: A complete drain of Treasury assets could render the protocol insolvent and disrupt its core operations.  
- **Loss of User Trust**: Exploitation of this issue would significantly damage the protocol's reputation and user confidence.

### Mitigation

**Use a Trusted Price Oracle**:
   - Fetch `usdtPrice` and `usdaPrice` from a reliable on-chain or off-chain price oracle instead of accepting user inputs.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     uint128 usdtPrice = oracle.getPrice(USDT);
     uint128 usdaPrice = oracle.getPrice(USDA);
     ```
