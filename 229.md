# Potential Miscalculations in `transferFundsToGlobal`

### Summary

In the `transferFundsToGlobal` function, there is potential confusion with array indices and transfer amounts, especially for index `i == 2`. This may lead to incorrect approvals, withdrawals, or transfers.


### Root Cause

In the loop handling `i == 2` (which corresponds to `WrsETH`), the function uses inconsistent indices for approvals and withdrawals:

```solidity
if (i == 2) {
    if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
    IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
    assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
}
```

Approves `transferAmounts[1]` instead of `transferAmounts[2]`.

### Impact

dos

### PoC

1. `transferAmounts[2]` is intended to be used, but `transferAmounts[1]` is approved, the approval amount may be incorrect.
2. This can prevent the withdrawal or cause it to process with an unintended amount.

### Mitigation

Ensure consistent use of indices:

```solidity
if (i == 2) {
    if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[2])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
    IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
    assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
}
```
