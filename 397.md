# Lack of access control in `executeSetterFunction()`

### Summary

Lack of access control in `executeSetterFunction()` - any user can call the function and reset approvals from owners to `false` values, leading to reverts of all setter functions in `CDS.sol`

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304-L313)

Any user can call the function and reset approvals from owners to `false` values:
```solidity
function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
        require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

If admin will call any setter function, it will revert, because with error `Borrow_RequiredApprovalsNotMetToSet`:
```solidity
function setLTV(uint8 ltv) external onlyAdmin {
        // Check ltv is non zero
        if (ltv == 0) revert Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
        // Check whether, the function have required approvals from owners to set
        if (!multiSign.executeSetterFunction(IMultiSign.SetterFunctions(0))) revert Borrow_RequiredApprovalsNotMetToSet();
        LTV = ltv;
    }
```

### Attack Path

Attackers can spam calls to `executeSetterFunction()`, constantly resetting approvals to `false`.

Although the problem can be mitigated if all owners will call again `approveSetterFunction`, the issue still falls under 7-day DoS due to following reasons:
- Admin cannot prevent the issue by calling a setter function and `approveSetterFunction` in the same transaction, because `approveSetterFunction` must be called directly by all owners, while setter function is called by borrowing admin.
- Gas prices on L2 are very low, so attackers can spam calls to `executeSetterFunction()`, so it's very unlikely that last owner's `approveSetterFunction` call and setter function will be executed one by another.

It is also worth noting that this protocol is dynamic and closely depends on the volatile ETH price. Delayed update of variables such as `LTV`, `APR`, `ratePerSec`, `bondRatio`, `usdaLimit` `usdtLimit` will negatively affect such protocol functions as yield generating, liquidation, borrowing and deposit/withdraw, since all these variables are involved in almost all functions and calculations of the protocol.



### Impact

DoS of all setter functions will lead to loses for protocol/users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow only `borrowing.sol`/`CDS.sol` contracts to call `executeSetterFunction()`.
