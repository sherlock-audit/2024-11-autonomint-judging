# Strike price manipulation lets borrowers underpay for ETH upside

### Summary

When a borrower deposits collateral to borrow USDa, they also purchase a call option that gives them exposure to ETH price increases by selecting a `IOptions.StrikePrice` and a `strikePrice`:
```solidity
struct BorrowDepositParams {
@>        IOptions.StrikePrice strikePercent;
@>        uint64 strikePrice;
        uint256 volatility;
        AssetName assetName;
        uint256 depositingAmount;
    }
```

`IOptions.StrikePrice` is used in `Options::calculateOptionPrice()` to determine the price of the option to charge the borrower. The higher the StrikePrice (e.g. TWENTY_FIVE > FIVE), the cheaper the cost of the option:
```solidity
enum StrikePrice {
        FIVE,
        TEN,
        FIFTEEN,
        TWENTY,
        TWENTY_FIVE
    }
```

When a borrower withdraws their collateral, `Options::calculateStrikePriceGains()` is called. If the price of ETH is greater than the `uint64 strikePrice`, the borrower gets to realize that upside:
```solidity
function calculateStrikePriceGains(
        uint128 depositedAmount,
        uint128 strikePrice,
        uint64 ethPrice
    ) external view onlyBorrowingContract returns (uint128) {

        require(depositedAmount != 0 && strikePrice != 0 && ethPrice != 0,"Zero inputs in options");
        uint64 currentEthPrice = ethPrice;

        uint128 currentEthValue = depositedAmount * currentEthPrice;
        uint128 ethToReturn;

        if (currentEthValue > strikePrice) {
@>            ethToReturn = (currentEthValue - strikePrice) / currentEthPrice;
        } else {
            ethToReturn = 0;
        }
        return ethToReturn;
    }

```

The issue is there's no check to ensure that `IOptions.StrikePrice` and a `strikePrice` are aligned. A malicious borrower could select `IOptions.StrikePrice.TWENTY_FIVE` and pay the lowerst option fee, but then input the current price of ETH as the `strikePrice` giving them exposure to any increase in ETH price above the current price.

### Root Cause

The issue is there's no check to ensure that `IOptions.StrikePrice` and a `strikePrice` are aligned

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Borrowing is only allowed when the CDS pool value is at least 20% of the vault's collateral value.

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Let's say the current price of ETH is $1000
2. A malicious borrower calls `Borrowing.depositTokens` depositing 1e18 ETH as collateral and then passes in `IOptions.StrikePrice.TWENTY_FIVE` as the `strikePercent`. This means the strike price should be $1250, however, since there's no check validating this, the malicious borrower passes in $1000 as the `strikePrice`.
3. Say the price of ETH increases to $1100.
4. The malicious borrower calls `Borrowing::withDraw()`
5. When `Options::calculateStrikePriceGains()` is called during the withdraw, the malicious borrower shouldn't receive any ETH upside, but ends up receiving `((1e18 * 1100e2)-1000e20) / $1100e2 = 0.09e18 ETH` in upside.

### Impact

Loss of funds for dCDS depositors since these users are the ones funding the call options.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove `strikePrice` as an input parameter in the deposit and instead calculate it using `IOptions.StrikePrice` during the deposit.
