# No Check for Slippage in `swapCollateralForUSDT` Function

### Summary

The `swapCollateralForUSDT` function, responsible for swapping collateral for USDT using the Odos protocol, lacks a mechanism to protect against slippage. This could lead to the protocol receiving a significantly lower amount of USDT than expected, especially during price volatility or liquidity issues on the exchange.


### Root Cause

**Affected Code:**
```solidity
function swapCollateralForUSDT(
    IBorrowing.AssetName asset,
    uint256 swapAmount,
    bytes memory odosAssembledData
) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
    // ...
    // if the asset is native, pass as msg.value
    (bool success, bytes memory result) = odosRouterV2.call{value: asset == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? swapAmount : 0}(odosAssembledData);

    // check the swap is successful or not.
    if (!success) revert Treasury_SwapFailed();

    // return the usdt amount
    return abi.decode(result, (uint256));
}
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Financial losses for the protocol due to receiving less USDT than intended.
- Inability to meet user obligations if the protocol relies on the swapped USDT for withdrawals or other operations.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement a slippage tolerance mechanism, such as setting a minimum acceptable return amount before executing the swap.
