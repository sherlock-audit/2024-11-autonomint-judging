# Vulnerability in updateDownsideProtected Function Allows Unauthorized Manipulation of downsideProtected

### Summary

The updateDownsideProtected function lacks proper access control, allowing any external user to manipulate the downsideProtected variable. This vulnerability can be exploited to artificially inflate the downsideProtected amount, leading to potential financial losses and system instability.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the absence of access control mechanisms in the updateDownsideProtected function. The function is marked as external, allowing any external account to call it and modify the downsideProtected variable.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829-L831
```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```

The downside protection is intended to protect user party in instances of a drop in eth price and normally utilized in the borrowing.sol#_withdraw function which eventually calls the cds contract to the update downside value.  Because of last of protection in the above function, it is called by any user.

```solidity
             msg.sender
            );
        } else {
            // updating downside protected from this chain in CDS
            cds.updateDownsideProtected(downsideProtected);  //update Downside called from borrowing.sol
        }
        // Burn the borrow amount
        treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, address(this), downsideProtected);
        bool success = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), downsideProtected);
        if (!success) revert Borrow_BurnFailed();
    }
    ```

### Internal pre-conditions

There are no access control checks (e.g., onlyOwner, onlyAuthorized) to restrict who can call the function.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-An attacker identifies the updateDownsideProtected function as lacking access control.

-The attacker calls the updateDownsideProtected function with a large downsideProtectedAmount.

-The downsideProtected variable is incremented by the specified amount, leading to an inflated value.

-The attacker can repeat this process to further manipulate the downsideProtected variable.

### Impact

High.   Unrestricted access to downside protection means  totalCdsDepositedAmount can be manipulated and depleted to zero thereby leading to financial loss for the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict access to updateDownsideProtected() to only core contracts/borrowing.sol
 ```solidity
  function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external onlyBorrowingContract {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
   ```
