# ETH will be sent to wrong address during liquidation

### Summary

ETH will be sent to users address during `liquidationType1()` call, while it should be refunded to admin - caller of `liquidate()` function.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L281-L305)

If the liquidation amount to get from other is greater than zero, admin must provide some ETH amount to pay for LayerZero cross-chain call. If the liquidation amount is zero, there is no need to make cross-chain call, so admin should receive ETH back.
```solidity
        // If the liquidation amount to get from other is greater than zero,
        // Get the amount from other chain.
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain > 0) {
            // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
       >>>  globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: msg.value}(  <<<
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
                IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain),
                // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
                IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
                IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_LIQ,
                admin
            );
        }
        //...
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
       >>>  (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");  <<<
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```

The issue is that ETH is sent to liquidated user's address, not admin. The funds is provided by admin and belong to admin, even in `globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` refund address is set as admin's address.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

`liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` = 0
Issue will happen if other chain dont have any available liquidation amount.

```solidity
  // if tha other chain dont have any available liquidation amount
        if (totalAvailableLiqAmountInOtherChain == 0) {
            liqAmountToGet = 0;
        } else {
            //...
        }
        return liqAmountToGet;
```

### Attack Path

- Admin calls `borrowing.liquidate()` with `msg.value` = 0.2 ETH
- `fee.nativeFee` = 0.05 ETH, so 0.15 ETH sent to `borrowLiquidation.sol`:
```solidity 
CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo = borrowLiquidation
            .liquidateBorrowPosition{value: msg.value - fee.nativeFee}(
            user,
            index,
            uint64(ethPrice),
            liquidationType,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
```
- `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` = 0, so 0.15 ETH should be sent back to admin
- Liquidated user receives 0.15 ETH

### Impact

ETH will be sent to wrong address during liquidation.

### Mitigation

```diff
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
-           (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");  
+           (bool sent, ) = payable(admin).call{value: msg.value}(""); 
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```
