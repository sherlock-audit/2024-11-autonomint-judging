# `transferFundsToGlobal` will revert in a majority of cases

### Summary

`transferFundsToGlobal` is called in the `_lzReceive` function of GlobalVariables when transferring tokens to the other chain. The issue is that incorrect token approval is performed, which will likely cause the call to revert due to an insufficient token allowance.

### Root Cause

In Treasury.transferFundsToGlobal:783 if the token being transferred is rsETH the function approves wrsETH to transfer `transferAmounts[1]` number of wrsETH tokens. This is implemented in order to unwrap the wrsETH tokens and after that transfer rsETH to the other chain. 

The issue is that the approval amount is incorrect as the index of wrsETH is 2 and the amount of wrsETH unwrapped is equal to `transferAmounts[2]`. `transferAmounts[1]` points to the transfer amount of the weETH token, therefore if the transferred weETH is less than the amount of wrsETH intended to be transferred, the allowance will be insufficient and `IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw` will revert.

### Attack Path

1. The other chain requests 2 ETH of weETH and 3 ETH of wrsETH.
2. When transferring the tokens from the Treasury to the GlobalVariables contract 3 ETH of wrsETH must be unwrapped, in order to do that the wrsETH must have a sufficient allowance.
3. However, wrsETH is only approved 2 ETH, due to the issue explained above.
4. As a result the call reverts and the other chain cannot receive the required tokens.

### Impact

Token transfers from one chain to another will revert in many cases, preventing the fulfillment of LayerZero token requests. Such token requests are performed when withdrawing from CDS when collateral must be provided by the other chain.

### Mitigation

Approve wrsETH of `transferAmounts[2]` instead of `transferAmounts[1]`.
