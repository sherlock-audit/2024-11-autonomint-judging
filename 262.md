# Unsafe Price Casting from uint128 to uint64 Leads to Price Overflow in `withDraw()`

## Summary:
In the borrowing contract's `withDraw` function, the ETH price is unsafely cast from `uint128` to `uint64`. Since ETH prices in wei (with 18 decimals) will always exceed the maximum value of uint64, this causes price overflow and could lead to incorrect valuations affecting withdrawals and liquidations.

## Details:
The vulnerability exists in the price casting within the withdrawal flow:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L302

```solidity
// original price fetched returns uint128
        (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[getBorrowingResult.depositDetails.assetName]);
        
        ....

       _withdraw(
                toAddress,
                index,
                odosAssembledData,
                uint64(ethPrice), // @audit unsafe casting causing overflow
                exchangeRate,
                uint64(block.timestamp)
            );
```
The maximum value of uint64 is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (2^64 - 1). However, ETH prices in wei (with 18 decimals) will always exceed this. For example, an ETH price of just $1 would be:

1 * 10^18 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei

This already approaches the uint64 max. Current ETH prices around $3,000 would be:

3,000 * 10^18 = 3,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei

This vastly exceeds uint64.max and will cause overflow, resulting in incorrect price values being used in calculations.

```solidity
function testPriceOverflow() public {
      // Setup ETH price at $3,000
      uint128 originalPrice = uint128(3000 1018);
      // Cast to uint64 as done in contract
      uint64 overflowedPrice = uint64(originalPrice);
      console.log("Original price (wei):", originalPrice);
      console.log("After uint64 cast (wei):", overflowedPrice);
      console.log("uint64 max:", type(uint64).max);
      // Price will be completely wrong
      assertNotEq(originalPrice, overflowedPrice);
      // Actual value will be original % 2^64
      // Leading to severely incorrect valuations
      assertTrue(overflowedPrice < originalPrice);
}
```

## Recommendation:
The simplest and most effective fix is to maintain the uint128 type throughout the price handling flow
