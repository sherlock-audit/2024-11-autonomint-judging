# user will pay more debt because cumulative rate isn't updated before their deposit

### Summary

The cumulative rate is used to calculate the user's debt amount. By not using the up-to-date value on deposits, the user will pay more interest on their debt than they should.

### Root Cause

In [BorrowLib.sol:750](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L750) the user's normalized amount is calculated as: `amount * RATE_PRECISION / cumulativeRate`, where `amount` is the amount of USDa the user borrows.

Later on, when the user decides to repay their debt, it calculates the user's total debt in [BorrowLib.sol:825](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L825) as `amount * cumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION` where `amount` is the value calculated in L750.

Meaning, the calculation of the total debt depends on the `cumulativeRate` value. The bigger the difference between the cumulative rate at the time of the deposit and repayment, the higher the interest the user has to pay.

The `cumulativeRate` is not updated prior to the user's deposit. Instead, it's updated **after** their deposit, see [borrowing.sol:L241](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L241C1-L257C35)

The calculation of the cumulative rate is time-based. Meaning, if there is a period where no one interacts with the contract, the next caller will use outdated values, see [BorrowLib.sol:229](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L229)

```sol
    function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        // If there is no borrowers in the protocol
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            // current cumulative rate is same as ratePeSec
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Find time interval between last event and now
            uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            //calculate cumulative rate
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
