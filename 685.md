# Missing slippage protection during withdrawal while swaping a portion of the collateral upside

### Summary

During [withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L672), a portion of the collateral upside is swapped to USDC using the `odosRouter` for the `treasury`


### Root Cause

The problem is that there is no slippage protection in the [amount received from the swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L830-L836) (and the returned amount is not checked to at least be greater than zero) and as such the swap could have suffered a very high slippage and the returned amount will be very small leading to a loss of funds.

```solidity
File: borrowing.sol
668:         if (amountToSwap > 0) {
669:             // found the exact amount of collateral
670:             amountToSwap = (amountToSwap * 1 ether) / exchangeRate;
671:             // call the swapCollateralForUSDT in treasury
672:    @>       treasury.swapCollateralForUSDT(depositDetail.assetName, amountToSwap, odosAssembledData); // USDT amount id returned to treasury here
673:         }


File: Treasury.sol
804:     function swapCollateralForUSDT(
805:         IBorrowing.AssetName asset,
806:         uint256 swapAmount,
807:         bytes memory odosAssembledData

/////           .......................
828:         // paas the odos assembled data as msg.data to routerV2 contract of odos
829:         // if the asset is native, pass as msg.value
830:   @>    (bool success, bytes memory result) = odosRouterV2.call{value: asset == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? swapAmount : 0}(odosAssembledData);
831: 
832:         // check the swap is successfull or not.
833:         if (!success) revert Treasury_SwapFailed();
834: 
835:         // return the usdt amount
836:  @>     return abi.decode(result, (uint256));
