# Incorrent state update for the caller instead of `from` in `ABONDToken::transferFrom` function can lead to unexpected outcomes

### Summary

The `transferFrom` function in the `ABONDToken` contract is designed to transfer tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address. It first updates the `State` structs of both the `from` and `to` addresses before transferring the tokens. However, during the state update, it mistakenly assigns the caller's `(msg.sender)` state to the `from` address's updated state. This leads to an incorrect state change, where the caller's state is overwritten and the from address's state remains unmodified

### Root Cause

```solidity
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;

```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This results in the caller's state being updated to the modified `from` state, which is not the intended behavior.

### PoC

Consider the `aBondBalance` of the `from`, `to`, and `msg.sender` (caller) before the transfer. For simplicity, cumulativeRate and ethBacked are not considered here, as they are updated differently: `to`'s state is adjusted based on the transferred amount, while `from`'s cumulativeRate and ethBacked remain unchanged.

Initial Balances:
aBondBalance of `from`: 2000
aBondBalance of `to`: 2500
aBondBalance of `msg.sender`: 2800

The caller has an allowance of 1000 tokens from the `from` address and transfers these tokens to the `to` address.

Expected Balances After Transfer:

aBondBalance of `from`: 1000 (debited 1000 tokens)
aBondBalance of `to`: 3500 (credited 1000 tokens)
aBondBalance of `msg.sender`: 2800 (unchanged)

Actual Outcome with Current Logic:
The `msg.sender`'s state is mistakenly overwritten with the updated state of the `from` address. As a result, the `msg.sender` loses 1800 tokens (their aBondBalance becomes 1000, the same as the updated `from` balance), which is incorrect.


### Mitigation

```diff
-     userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;
+    userStates[from] = fromState;

```
