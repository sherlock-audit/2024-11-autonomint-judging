# No oracle for wrsEth exists on Mode L2 Network

### Summary
For the Mode L2 network, the protocol uses Redstone Oracle. However, Redstone Oracle currently does not have a `wrsEth` asset feed on Mode L2.

### Root Cause
In the `MasterPriceOracle`, we are supposed to set up addresses for the oracle feeds. However, a feed for `wrsEth` on Mode L2 by Redstone Oracle does not exist. Despite this, `wrsEth` is allowed as collateral, and using an inaccurate oracle exchange rate could lead to an insolvent protocol.

Reference from readme:
> If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?
>
>We are allowing only whitelisted tokens like wrsEth, weETH, ETH and USDa(Our own token) in borrowing contracts. And in dCDS we are allowing tokens like USDa(Our own token), USDT and Abond(Our own token) for redeeming.

Query for the feed on Redstone Oracle: https://app.redstone.finance/app/feeds/?search=wrsETH&page=1&sortBy=popularity&sortDesc=false&perPage=32

This is a problem, as we can currently use `wrsETH` for collateral when borrowing, but, as mentioned, there isn't such a feed. 
So, when we go into the `underlying = 0x4186BFC76E2E237523CBC30FD220FE055156b41F;` case, we are essentially setting the `rsETH` feed, as `0x4186BFC76E2E237523CBC30FD220FE055156b41F` is what this address corresponds to. 
However, we specify the `IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH` borrowing asset, not the `rsETH` one.

### Impact
On Redstone Oracle, we only have the `rsETH` feed. However, the price would be inaccurate if we use it, as the prices of `rsETH` and `wrsETH` can differ by a few percent:
- https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kelp-dao-restaked-eth/
- https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kelp-dao-wrapped-rseth/

This discrepancy would result in inaccurate calculations for the LTV and may cause the protocol to believe it has more or fewer resources than it actually does. This could also lead to users withdrawing more than the protocol can afford, potentially making it insolvent, depending on whether `rsETH` or `wrsETH` has the higher price.

We use the exchange rate when calling the `deposit` function in the borrowing feature, which will be incorrect in this case, as we use the `rsETH` exchange rate instead of the `wrsETH` exchange rate when depositing `wrsETH`.
```solidity
    function deposit(
        IBorrowing.BorrowLibDeposit_Params memory libParams,
        IBorrowing.BorrowDepositParams memory params,
        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        mapping(IBorrowing.AssetName => address assetAddress) storage assetAddress
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 depositingAmount = params.depositingAmount;
        // Check the deposting amount is non zero
        if (params.depositingAmount == 0) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();

        // Calculate the depsoting amount in ETH
@>>     params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;
```

### Mitigation
Consider only allowing rsETH as a deposit for collateral and adapt the code logic for that/use another oracle that offers wrsETH feed.
