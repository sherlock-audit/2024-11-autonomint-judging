# The borrower does not have an option not to choose options

### Summary
The code does not comply with the docs. In the docs its mentioned that optionFees for downside protection are optional and should not be enforced during deposit of a borrower.

### Root cause
From the docs:
https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/our-solution#collateral-options
> "The idea behind collateral options is to **give an option to the borrower** for creating lossless strategies. In traditional finance, people buy options to hedge their downside and create a limited loss strategy. Using the same method, upside is maintained as the collateral options are a form of call options that allows the borrower to earn all the upside above a particular strike price. Borrowers **will be able to buy a call option** and downside protection while taking a  loan against Ethereum or any other collateral through our borrowing contract. **There is no need to pay any upfront option fees for the borrower to hedge the downside risk.**"

However the codebase currently enforces you to mandatory opt-in for the option, by forcing you to pay the optionFees. Also there isn't a logic in the codebase that allows to not opt-in.
[BorrowLib.sol#L673-L679](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L673-L679)
```solidity
    function deposit(..... ) public returns (uint256) {
....Skip Code....
        // Call calculateOptionPrice in options contract to get options fees
@>>    uint256 optionFees = interfaces.options.calculateOptionPrice(
            libParams.ethPrice,
            params.volatility,
            params.depositingAmount,
            params.strikePercent
        );
....Skip Code....

        // Call the transfer function to mint USDa
        uint256 tokensToMint = transferToken(
            interfaces.usda,
            libParams.LTV,
            address(interfaces.treasury),
            msg.sender,
            params.depositingAmount,
            libParams.ethPrice,
@>>         optionFees
        );

....Skip Code....
        return libParams.totalNormalizedAmount;
    }
```

### Impact
Current codebase forces borrowers to pay optionFees and does not them to opt-out of the option to buy downside protection.
