# Lack of access control for function calculateCumulativeRate()

### Summary

We lack of access control for function calculateCumulativeRate(). This will cause that anyone can repeat triggering this function and after that borrowers need to pay more borrow interest than expected.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing.sol:calculateCumulativeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L530), we will calculate the cumulative value based on `lastEventTime`.

We should notice that we will not update the `lastEventTime` in this function. So we can find that deposit/withdraw function will trigger calculateCumulativeRate() and then update `lastEventTime`.

The problem here is that we can trigger this calculateCumulativeRate() dependently. Because we don't update `lastEventTime`, we can repeat triggering this function to increase `lastCumulativeRate` a lot. This will cause that previous borrowers have to pay a lot more borrow interest than expected.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
