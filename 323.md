# Slippage protection in GlobalVariables is too strict

### Summary

The slippage protection implemented in the _lzReceive() function is too strict, causing unnecessary reverts when minor adjustments (such as dust removal or fees) reduce the amountReceivedLD below _minAmountLD. This restrictiveness can block legitimate transactions and disrupt cross-chain operations.

### Root Cause

The slippage check in _lzReceive() directly compares amountReceivedLD with _minAmountLD without accounting for potential reductions from:
 - Dust removal (_removeDust()).
 - Fees applied during the transfer.
 - Rounding errors or negligible mismatches.

### Internal pre-conditions

_lzReceive() is invoked with amountReceivedLD and _minAmountLD as parameters.
Dust removal, fees, or minor mismatches reduce amountReceivedLD below _minAmountLD.

### External pre-conditions

A cross-chain transaction is initiated with exact or near-equal amountLD and minAmountLD values.
LayerZero's send() deducts fees or applies adjustments (e.g., dust removal) during the transaction.

### Attack Path

A legitimate transaction is submitted.
During execution:
  Dust removal slightly reduces amountLD.
  Fees are deducted, reducing the effective amountReceivedLD.
IOFT.send() performs the strict slippage check and this tx reverts.

### Impact

Legitimate cross-chain transactions revert unnecessarily, leading to delays and poor user experience.
Critical contract functions relying on _lzReceive() could be blocked if even minor adjustments trigger a revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce slippage tolerance buffer or adjust _minAmountLD for dust removal.
