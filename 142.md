# Profit/Loss will be wrongly updated between concecutive deposits

### Summary

`LastEthPrice` is not updated betweeen consecutive deposits, which may lead to internal accounting errors 

### Root Cause

In `borrowing.sol::deposit` , `lastEthPrice` is not updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

In the borrowing module where depositing of collateral and minting of the coresponding usda token takes place, a call to the `borrowing.sol::depositTokens` function is passed to `BorrowLib.deposit` to perform certain calculations and state updates. Within the `BorrowLib.deposit` function, there is a call to `BorrowLib.calculateRatio` .  Amongst the major calculation/state updates that `calculateRatio`  function performs, this finding only focuses on the portion of the code that updates profit/loss based on the difference between the `currentEthPrice` and the `LastEthPrice`.

169        if (currentEthPrice > lastEthprice) {
170            // profit, multiply the price difference with total collateral

196            }
197
198            // Set the currentCDSPoolValue to lastCDSPoolValue for next deposit
199            previousData.cdsPoolValue = currentCDSPoolValue;
200            currentCDSPoolValue = currentCDSPoolValue * USDA_PRECISION;
201        } else {
202            // find current vault value by adding current depositing amount
203            currentVaultValue = previousData.vaultValue + (amount * currentEthPrice);
204            previousData.vaultValue = currentVaultValue;
205
206            // BAsed on the eth prices, add or sub, profit and loss respectively
207            if (currentEthPrice >= lastEthprice) {
208@>>             previousData.cdsPoolValue += netPLCdsPool;
209            } else {
210@>>             previousData.cdsPoolValue -= netPLCdsPool;
211            }
```
From the snippet above , we can see that `netPLCdsPool` is calculated based on the difference between the `lastEthPrice` and the `currentEthPrice`.  Supposse there are 100 consecutive deposits happening at `currentEthPrice` = `105` after the update of `lastEthPrice` to `100`, with no withdraw action between them (since withdraw updates the `lastEthPrice`) . The implication of this issue is that `netPLCdsPool` will always be nonzero since lastEthPrice will not be updated after each deposit. There are a number of scenarios that will demonstrate either over/underestimation of profit/loss. Take the scenario below as an example.
Scenario:
Note: The `netPLCdsPool` formula has been simplified to netPLCdsPool = (((currentEthPrice - lastEthprice) * totalCollateralInETH) for easy demonstraction.
* Assume `lastEthPrice` = 100 at first deposit.
* `currentEthPrice` = 105 at first deposit.
*  `totalCollateralInETH` = `1000` (total collaterals  deposited before the consecutive 100 deposits)

$$
netPLCdsPool = (105 - 100) × 1000
$$

$$
netPLCdsPool = 5 × 1000
$$

This action will result in the update of the omnichain [`cdsPoolValue` to a sum of 5000 + its initial value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L661-L783).
since `lastEthPrice` is not updated to `105`. While the 99 other deposits happen at  `currentEthPrice` = `105`, and should record no net profit or loss,  `netPLCdsPool` will always be a nonzero value (5 * totalCollateralInETH) which will wrongly update omnichain `cdsPoolValue`, to a ridiculously large amount.

### Impact

This will directly lead to loss of funds, due to wrong internal accounting:
1. Early withdrawers will claim the excees added values in profit, and Dos last withdrawer
2. The errors might be falling to the loss side, where users may be in excess loss than normal due to consecutive deposits, while prices might have changed in their favour.
3.  An attacker can weaponize this, by carrying out several deposit of a very tiny amount to increase the profit, and withdraw their funds in profit, while last withdrawers will be in loss. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update the lastEthPrice after deposit in the `borrowing.sol::deposit` function
