# `borrowLiqudation::executeOrdersInSynthetix()` is uncallable

### Summary

`borrowLiquidation::executeOrdersInSynthetix()` sends `{value: 1}`, but there is no `receive()` in `borrowLiqudation.sol`, thus making it impossible to actually invoke it.

### Root Cause

The root cause is not having a `receive()` function in `borrowLiqudation.sol` for a EOA/Contract send Ether to it, so that `executeOrdersInSynthetix()` can be actually invoked.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Admin liquidates `borrowing::liquidate()`, which then calls `borrowLiquidation::liquidateBorrowPosition()` with the second liquidation type so that it can submit an order to synthetix perps v2, and then execute it.
2. Admin then calls `borrowing::executeOrdersInSynthetix()`, but `borrowLiquidation::executeOrdersInSynthetix()` sends one wei as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L385), and reverts due to the contract not having Ether in it 

### Impact

The second liquidation type can't be used, thus breaking core protocol functionality which is liquidation, specifically the second type of liquidation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `receive()` in `borrowLiquidation.sol` and a `withdrawEth()` in it, if for some case the protocol wants to withdraw part of the Ether that was deposited for gas.
