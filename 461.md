# users can pass arbitrary volatility as parameter to Borrowing::depositTokens and change option fee in favor of themself

### Summary

users can pass arbitrary volatility as parameter to `Borrowing::depositTokens` and change option fee in favor of themself

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L227

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L674

as we can see there isn't any validation for volatility and volatility has effect on OptionFees and also volatility will be fetched from Bybit in transactions created by normal users

### PoC

optionFee and volatility have a reverse relation with each other and and when volatility increase optionFee decrease accordingly and users can with see high volatility pay less option fee


### Impact
loss of funds for protocol and CDS depositors 

### Mitigation

consider to validate volatility
