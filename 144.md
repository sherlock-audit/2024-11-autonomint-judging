# Malicious users will extract value from the protocol through RedStone Oracle price time manipulation

### Summary

The `Borrowing.sol` contract lacks proper price validation in the `getUSDValue()` function, which could allow malicious users to manipulate prices during critical operations like deposits, withdrawals, and liquidations.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L434

```solidity
function getUSDValue(address token) public view returns (uint128, uint128) {
    return oracle.price(token);
}
```

### Root Cause

The `getUSDValue()` function simply forwards the price from the `BasePriceOracle` without any additional validation or checks. This price is used in critical functions:

1. In `depositTokens()`:
```solidity
(uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[depositParam.assetName]);
```

2. In `withDraw()`:
```solidity
(uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[getBorrowingResult.depositDetails.assetName]);
```

3. In `liquidate()`:
```solidity
(, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[AssetName.ETH]);
```

The contract stores the last ETH price but doesn't use it for validation:
```solidity
lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. LTV needs to be set by admin (via `setLTV()`) to a non-zero value for deposits to be processed:
```solidity
function setLTV(uint8 ltv) external onlyAdmin {
    if (ltv == 0) revert Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
    [...] 
    LTV = ltv;
}
```
2. APR and ratePerSec need to be set by admin (via `setAPR()`) to non-zero values for interest calculations:
```solidity
function setAPR(uint8 _APR, uint128 _ratePerSec) external whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(3)) onlyAdmin {
    if (_ratePerSec == 0 || _APR == 0) revert Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
    [...]
}
```
3. Relevant functions must not be paused in the MultiSign contract:
   - Functions(0) for deposits
   - Functions(1) for withdrawals 
   - Functions(2) for liquidations

### External pre-conditions

1. Oracle price feed must provide significantly different prices within the same block or consecutive blocks:
2. Transaction must be able to be executed within the oracle's price update window:

### Impact

The lack of price validation creates several risks:

1. **Deposit Manipulation**: Users could time their deposits when oracle prices are artificially high, receiving more USDa than their collateral is actually worth

2. **Withdrawal Exploitation**: Users could withdraw collateral when oracle prices are artificially low, extracting more value than originally deposited

3. **Liquidation Gaming**: Malicious actors could manipulate liquidations by timing them with favorable oracle prices

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Implement price deviation checks:
```solidity
function getUSDValue(address token) public view returns (uint128, uint128) {
    (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = oracle.price(token);
    
    // If this is an ETH price update
    if (token == assetAddress[AssetName.ETH]) {
        uint256 deviation = calculateDeviation(lastEthprice, ethPrice);
        require(deviation <= MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION, "Price deviation too high");
    }
    
    return (exchangeRate, ethPrice);
}
```

2. Add minimum time between price updates:
```solidity
require(block.timestamp >= lastEventTime + MIN_UPDATE_DELAY, "Update too soon");
```
