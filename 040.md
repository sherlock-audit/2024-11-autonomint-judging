# All exchange rates are incorrect, except in the case of ETH.

### Summary

The following lines of code contain incorrect `exchangeRate` calculations:  
- [CDS.sol: Lines 302-303] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L302-L303)  
- [borrowLiquidation.sol: Line 187] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L187)  
- [borrowing.sol: Line 239] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L239)  
- [borrowing.sol: Line 294] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L294) 

The `exchangeRate` calculated in the above locations is incorrect due to a flawed calculation logic in the `price` function found in `MasterPriceOracle.sol`.

### Root Cause

The `price` function is returning the token price in USD instead of the exchange rate in ETH.  
Refer to the following code:  
- [MasterPriceOracle.sol: Lines 83-91] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83-L91)

### Impact

This issue can lead to significant confusion in the price calculations throughout the protocol, including the depositing and withdrawing of USDa, USDT, and collaterals.
e.g: The deposit amount can often be 0 because the token price in USD is significantly less than 1e18. Then causes the transaction to revert.

### Mitigation

To correct this issue, the following changes should be made to the code:

```solidity
-    return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
```

```solidity
+    return (uint128(uint256(price_) * 1e18 / ethPrice), ethPrice);
```
