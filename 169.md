# `Abond_Token::transferFrom` incorrectly updates `msg.sender` state instead of `from`

### Summary

The `transferFrom` function in the `Abond_Token` contract incorrectly updates the `msg.sender`'s state instead of the `from` address (the bond owner). This causes the `msg.sender` to lose funds unnecessarily and results in an incorrect state for the `from` address.


### Root Cause


The issue lies in the following [lines of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L165):

```solidity
// update sender state
fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState; // Incorrectly updates msg.sender instead of from
```

The `userStates` mapping is updated for `msg.sender` instead of the `from` address, which leads to a mismatch between the actual balances and the recorded states.
### Correct Logic:
The `userStates` mapping should be updated for the `from` address as it represents the sender of the `value`.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Loss of funds for `msg.sender`**: The state of `msg.sender` is debited incorrectly.
- **Inconsistent state**: The `from` address does not reflect the correct updated state.
- **Potential exploits**: Incorrect logic can lead to unintended loss of funds and exploitation in edge cases.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the code to correctly reference the `from` address when updating the `userStates` mapping:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 value
) public override returns (bool) {
    require(from != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User");

    // Get sender and receiver states
    State memory fromState = userStates[from];
    State memory toState = userStates[to];

    // Update receiver state
    toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value));
    userStates[to] = toState;

    // Update sender state
    fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
    userStates[from] = fromState; // Correctly update the `from` address

    // Transfer abond
    super.transferFrom(from, to, value);
    return true;
}
```
