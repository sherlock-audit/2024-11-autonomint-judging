# Excess ETH Stuck in CDS Contract Due to Lack of Refund Mechanism

### Summary

The deposit and redeemUSDT functions in the CDS contract and depositTokens in borrowing contract use LayerZero's cross-chain messaging to send transactions. These functions calculate the messaging fee (fee.nativeFee) and send it to the globalVariables.send function. However, if the user provides a msg.value higher than the calculated fee, the excess ETH (msg.value - fee.nativeFee) remains stuck in the CDS contract, as there is no mechanism to refund this excess amount.

### Root Cause

Cross-chain gas fees are dynamic. When calculating layer zero fees, a quote function should be generated right before calling _lzSend to ensure accurate pricing. Because of this, quoted fees can be different between the time a user sends a TX and the time the TX is executed. This can lead to users sending higher values than the current fee calculated

In the `deposit` and `redeemUSDT` functions `globalVariables.send` function only use ` fee.nativeFee` amount and ignores any excess ETH provided in msg.value. LayerZero refunds any unused ETH sent with `fee.nativeFee`, but any ETH beyond this value (msg.value - fee.nativeFee) is not accounted for, leading to a loss of funds for the user.

```solidity
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            IBorrowing.AssetName(0),
            _options,
            false
        );

        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            IBorrowing.AssetName(0),
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user calls deposit or redeemUSdt with quoted msg.value
2. At the time tx executed calculated fee.nativeFee decreases so msg.value is higher.
3. The globalVariables.send function processes only fee.nativeFee.,
4. The excess ETH (msg.value - fee.nativeFee) remains stuck in the contract.
5. Users are unable to retrieve this excess ETH as there is no refund mechanism implemented.



### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users lose excess ETH sent with msg.value

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement logic to refund any excess ETH sent by the user.
