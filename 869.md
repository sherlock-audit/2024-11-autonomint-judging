# Downside Protection Granted to Borrowers After Option Maturity Expiry in borrowing::withDraw

### Summary

Borrowers in the protocol currently receive downside protection when withdrawing (repaying the loan) within 30 days of their loan maturity, as long as an option fee was paid during the loan deposit. This protection is granted regardless of whether the borrower renews their options within the 30-day maturity window. However, once the maturity period of the options exceeds 30 days, borrowers should no longer receive downside protection. Due to the absence of a check to ensure the `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` falls within the 30-day maturity period, borrowers who have not renewed their options for more than 30 days still receive downside protection, which results in the borrower paying back less than the intended amount. This poses a financial risk to the protocol, leading to unintended benefits for borrowers.

### Root Cause

The issue arises because there is no check in place to validate that the borrower's `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` is within the 30-day maturity window from the current block timestamp. As a result, borrowers who have not renewed their options for over 30 days still receive downside protection, reducing their repayment amount and causing the protocol to suffer financial losses. The specific issue can be observed in the following code, where the downside protection is [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L826) regardless of the option renewal status:

```solidity
uint128 downsideProtected = calculateDownsideProtected(
    depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, params.ethPrice, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit
);
```

Later in the code, this [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L840) downside protection amount is deducted from the total debt owed, leading to the borrower paying less than the intended amount:

```solidity
depositDetail.totalDebtAmountPaid = borrowerDebt - downsideProtected;
```

### Internal Pre-Conditions

The downside protection is calculated as a positive value when the collateral's value at the time of deposit exceeds the current ETH price (i.e., when the collateral price has fallen).

### External Pre-Conditions

None specified.

### Attack Path

- A borrower takes a debt (makes a deposit).
- The borrower fails to repay the debt and does not renew the options for an extended period (e.g., a year).
- When the borrower eventually repays the loan, they still receive the benefit of downside protection, paying less than the full amount owed due to the lack of a check on the option renewal status, as explained in the root cause.

### Impact

This oversight leads to unintended financial advantages for borrowers, as they are able to repay less than the intended debt amount even if they have not renewed their options. The protocol suffers financial losses as a result of borrowers receiving downside protection outside of the 30-day maturity period, despite not being eligible for it.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

Not provided.

### Mitigation

A check should be implemented to ensure that downside protection is only granted to borrowers whose `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` is within the 30-day maturity period. This would prevent borrowers from receiving downside protection if they have not renewed their options in time.
