# Incorrect Updating of `omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators` Leading to Underflow in CDS Withdrawals

### Summary

The `omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators` variable is incorrectly updated in the CDS withdrawal logic. Specifically, the updates to this variable only occur when params.ethAmount != 0, even though the total collateral withdrawn (totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH) includes multiple components: ethAmount, weETHAmount, and rsETHAmount. Again another amount in form of `params.ethAmount` is further removed from  the `omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators`. This discrepancy can result in an underflow, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) for the withdrawal function.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L825-L832
1. The logic for updating `omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators` is conditionally executed only when params.ethAmount != 0.

2. The interfaces.treasury.transferEthToCdsLiquidators function, which also reduces collateralProfitsOfLiquidators by params.ethAmount, is similarly wrapped in the same condition. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L641

The update logic does not account for scenarios where params.ethAmount is 0, but the total collateral withdrawal still includes weETHAmount or rsETHAmount, leaving collateralProfitsOfLiquidators improperly decremented.

And if  params.ethAmount is not zero, there is over decrementation which will lead to underflow error, leading to DOS of the CDS `withdraw` function

### Attack Path

### Impact

1. Denial of Service (DoS): The withdrawal function becomes inoperable due to an underflow error in collateralProfitsOfLiquidators.

2. Financial Discrepancies: Mismanagement of collateral tracking can lead to discrepancies in treasury accounting.

3. Security Vulnerability: Exploitable underflow opens the system to malicious actors deliberately causing a DoS or manipulating state variables.

### Mitigation

```diff
+                  params.omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators -= totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH; 

  if (params.ethAmount != 0) {
-                    params.omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators -= totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH; 
                    // Call transferEthToCdsLiquidators to tranfer eth
                    interfaces.treasury.transferEthToCdsLiquidators(
                        msg.sender,
                        params.ethAmount
                    );
    }
```

and then i n the transferEthToCdsLiquidators function 
```diff
 function transferEthToCdsLiquidators(
        address user,
        uint128 amount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
        require(user != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
        // Get the omnichain data
        IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory omniChainData = globalVariables.getOmniChainData();
        // Check whether treasury has enough collateral to transfer
        require(amount <= omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators,"Treasury don't have enough ETH amount");
-        omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators -= amount;
        globalVariables.setOmniChainData(omniChainData);

        // Transfer ETH to user
        (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: amount}("");
        if (!sent) revert Treasury_EthTransferToCdsLiquidatorFailed();
    }
```
