# Exploitable CDS Pool Mechanism Allows Borrowers to Protect Themselves Using Borrowed Funds

### Summary

The protocol's CDS pool mechanism allows borrowers to deposit their borrowed USDa into the CDS pool, effectively dominating the pool and securing disproportionate downside protection for their own positions. This creates a scenario where borrowers can significantly reduce their liquidation losses at the expense of other CDS providers, even with a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This behavior undermines the fairness of the CDS system and exposes the protocol to potential losses.
I should note that when someone borrowes an amount in the `Borrowing` contract, the [`ratio`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L218) check only evaluates the total `currentCDSPoolValue ` but not the [`availableLiquidationAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L648) this means that in a scenario where `availableLiquidationAmount = 1/3 currentCDSPoolValue` , the new borrowed Amount can actually be dominate the `availableLiquidationAmount` 


### Root Cause

1. Borrowers can use the USDa obtained from their loan to deposit into the CDS pool.
2. CDS protection is allocated based on the user's share in the pool, without distinguishing between funds contributed by borrowers and those contributed by other CDS providers.
3. During liquidation, borrowers with a dominant share in the CDS pool can secure a significant portion of their collateral while leaving other CDS providers with a smaller share of the losses

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A borrower deposits collateral and receives USDa at 60% LTV. (worst case scenario)
2. The borrower deposits the USDa into the CDS pool and opts for liquidation protection.

### External pre-conditions

1. The borrower’s collateral value drops significantly (e.g., ETH price crashes).
2. The borrower’s position is liquidated, triggering the CDS protection mechanism.

### Attack Path

Same scenario as Poc.

### Impact

Borrowers can repeatedly use this strategy to exploit the CDS system, reducing their liquidation impact while exposing the protocol to insolvency risks.
While the previous scenario highlight a scenario where attackers can profit from price drops by using borrowed money to protect themselves through CDS. This scenario might open up other attack vectors to profit from price drops on ETH, 

### PoC

1. User deposits 1000 ETH at $2000:
  - Total Value = $2M
  - Gets 60% LTV in USDa = $1.2M USDa
  - Puts all $1.2M USDa in CDS, opts for liquidation:
2. If this is 80% of totalAvailableLiquidation: (totally posssible as the ratio only checks for `totalCdsPoolvalue` )
  - Total CDS pool = $1.5M
  - Other users = $300k
3. ETH crashes to $1000:
  - Position value = $1M
  - Debt = $1.2M
4. Position gets liquidated
 - During liquidation:
 - Their CDS share = 80%
 - They get back 80% of their liquidated ETH
 - 800 ETH worth $800k
 - While other CDS providers split remaining 200 ETH ($200k)
5. Final Result:
The User have now aquired 1.2M USDa +800 ETH = 2M USDa at the ETH = 1000$
if he had held the position the 1000 ETH would have been worth 1M$
The protocol lost 1.2M$ USDa, the collateral (now worth only 1M$) was splited by the cds users .

### Mitigation

Impose a maximum share limit for any single user in the CDS pool for the `availableLiquidationAmount` to prevent dominance.
