# Withdrawing assets other than native ETH results in a loss.

### Summary

Withdrawing assets other than native ETH results in a loss because they don't provide them with ABOND.

### Root Cause

Unlike native ETH, `withDraw` burns all the USDA I borrowed and only returns half of the collateral I deposited.
