# Parameters Uninitialized Leading to Incorrect Calculations and Potential Loss

### Summary

The `Borrowing` contract does not initialize critical parameters such as `LTV`, `APR`, and `ratePerSec` during deployment. These parameters are essential for accurate calculations of loan amounts, interest rates, and cumulative rates throughout the contract. Without proper initialization, users can interact with the contract under incorrect assumptions, leading to miscalculations, unexpected behavior, and potential financial loss.

### Root Cause

In the `Borrowing` contract, variables `LTV`, `APR`, and `ratePerSec` are declared but not assigned initial values upon contract deployment. Since Solidity initializes these variables to zero by default, any calculations involving them yield incorrect results. For instance, if `LTV` is zero, depositing collateral will not result in any USDa tokens being minted for the user, effectively locking their collateral without compensation.



### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Deploy the `Borrowing` contract without setting `LTV`, `APR`, or `ratePerSec`.
2. Users interact with the contract by depositing collateral through the `depositTokens` function.
3. Due to uninitialized parameters, calculations within the function produce incorrect results (e.g., zero USDa minted).
4. Users' collateral is locked in the contract without receiving the expected USDa, leading to potential loss and loss of trust in the protocol.

### Impact

Loss of funds. 

### PoC


1. **Deployment without Initialization:**

   ```solidity
   // Upon deployment, critical parameters are not set
   Borrowing borrowing = new Borrowing();
   ```

2. **User Deposits Collateral:**

   ```solidity
   borrowing.depositTokens{value: collateralAmount}(
       Borrowing.BorrowDepositParams({
           strikePercent: IOptions.StrikePrice.ATM,
           strikePrice: 2000,
           volatility: 100,
           assetName: IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH,
           depositingAmount: collateralAmount
       })
   );
   ```

3. **Inside `depositTokens`, calculations use uninitialized `LTV`:**

   ```solidity
   // LTV is zero, so mintedAmount will be zero
   uint256 mintedAmount = (LTV * depositParam.depositingAmount) / 100;
   ```

4. **User Receives No USDa Tokens:**

   - The user receives zero USDa despite depositing collateral.
   - Collateral remains locked in the contract.

**In `Borrowing.sol`:**

```solidity
uint8 private LTV; // Loan to Value ratio
uint8 private APR; // Annual Percentage Rate
uint256 public lastCumulativeRate; // Cumulative interest rate
uint128 public ratePerSec; // Interest rate per second

function depositTokens(
    BorrowDepositParams memory depositParam
) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(0)) {
    // ...
    totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
        BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
            LTV,                // Uninitialized LTV (defaults to zero)
            APR,                // Uninitialized APR (defaults to zero)
            lastCumulativeRate,
            totalNormalizedAmount,
            exchangeRate,
            ethPrice,
            lastEthprice
        ),
        depositParam,
        Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options),
        assetAddress
    );
    // ...
}
```

### Mitigation

 **Initialize Critical Parameters Upon Deployment:**

  Assign default values to `LTV`, `APR`, and `ratePerSec` during contract deployment or within an `initialize` function protected by the `initializer` modifier.

  ```solidity
  function initialize(...) public initializer {
      // ...
      LTV = 60; // Example LTV of 60%
      APR = 5;  // Example APR of 5%
      ratePerSec = calculateRatePerSec(APR);
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **Enforce Initialization Before Interaction:**

  Add require statements in user-facing functions to ensure that critical parameters are set before allowing interaction.

  ```solidity
  require(LTV > 0, "LTV must be set before depositing.");
  require(APR > 0 && ratePerSec > 0, "Interest rates must be set before depositing.");
  ```
