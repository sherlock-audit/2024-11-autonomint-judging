# borrowers may fail to withdraw because of the imbalance cds deposit

### Summary

In _getDownsideFromCDS(), we will try to burn the `downsideProtected` usda. It's possible that there is not enough `downsideProtected` usda in this chain's treasury. This will cause withdraw revert.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing.sol:_getDownsideFromCDS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L721), we will process the downsideProtected if the Ether price drops compared with the deposited Ether price. if there is not enough USDA to cover the downsideProtected, we will connect with the other chain to transfer some UDSA to cover this downsideProtected.

Automint will be deployed into different chains, OP chain and Mode chain. So the cds deposit amount may be unbalanced. When users borrow USDa, we need to make sure there are enough global cds deposit amount to cover the downsideProtected.

Let's consider the below imbalance case:
1. Alice deposits cds USDT/USDA in Chain A. There is no any cds deposit in Chain B.
2. Bob borrows 1000 USDA from ChainB. This can work because we check the global cds deposit amount.
3. Ether price drops.
4. Bob withdraw his collateral in ChainB, and there is some downside protected amount(e.g. 100 USDA). In _getDownsideFromCDS(), we will try to burn 100 USDA from the treasury. The problem is that there is only a few borrow interest(e.g. 1 USDA) from Bob in the treasury contract.
5. Bob's withdraw will be reverted.
```solidity
    function _getDownsideFromCDS(
        uint128 downsideProtected,
        uint256 feeForOFT
    ) internal {
        if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
            globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: feeForOFT}(
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
                IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),downsideProtected - cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()),
                IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
                IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_WITHDRAW,
                msg.sender
            );
        } else {
            cds.updateDownsideProtected(downsideProtected);
        }
        treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, address(this), downsideProtected);
        bool success = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), downsideProtected);
        if (!success) revert Borrow_BurnFailed();
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

CDS deposit is not balanced. One chain's cds deposit amount is quite small, cannot cover the downside protected amount.

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits cds USDT/USDA in Chain A. There is no any cds deposit in Chain B.
2. Bob borrows 1000 USDA from ChainB. This can work because we check the global cds deposit amount.
3. Ether price drops.
4. Bob withdraw his collateral in ChainB, and there is some downside protected amount(e.g. 100 USDA). In _getDownsideFromCDS(), we will try to burn 100 USDA from the treasury. The problem is that there is only a few borrow interest(e.g. 1 USDA) from Bob in the treasury contract.
5. Bob's withdraw will be reverted.

### Impact

Users fail to withdraw their collateral.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Considering that we've already connected with the other chain to transfer some USDA to cover the downside protected amount, we can burn this part of usda when we receive USDA from the other chain.
