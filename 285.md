# The "Utilizing USDT deposited in dCDS for immediate re-deemability" Peg Stabilization Module is broken because `CDS::redeemUSDT` acts as a one-way exchange and does not create incentives

### Summary

The actual implementation of the "Utilizing USDT deposited in dCDS for immediate re-deemability" Peg Stabilization Module will never work. When redeeming in `CDS::redeemUSDT`, the `usdtAmount` to give to the user in exchange for the `usdaAmount` that will be burned is calculated purely based on market prices which does not create an incentive for users to redeem `USDT` because the `CDS::redeemUSDT` function will behave as an exchange.

```solidity
uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```

For this Peg Stabilization Module to work, there should be some incentives for arbitrageurs to buy `USDa` in an external market to create a demand that will increase the `USDa` price and then redeem them for `USDT`.

The best option in this case to make this Peg Stabilization Module work is to copy the `MakerDao Peg Stabilization Module`: https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-maker-simulation-series-peg-stability-module

### Root Cause

The `CDSLib::redeemUSDT` function calculates the `usdtAmount` based on market prices:
