# optionfees from this chain(params.optionFees - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain)  should be deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees but params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain is deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees in the  function withdrawUser.

### Summary

 in the  function withdrawUser(cdslib.sol),  if (
                    params.ethAmount == 0 &&
                    weETHAmount == 0 &&
                    rsETHAmount == 0 &&
                    collateralToGetFromOtherChain == 0
                ), when the above statement is true, then  totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees(for this chain/market) is updated correctly i.e  totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= (params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount + (params.optionFees - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain)); i.e optionfees from this chain is deducted which is correct.
But if the above statement is false, then totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees(for this chain/market) is not  updated correctly i.e totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= (params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount + params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain); i.e params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain is deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees which is incorrect. As a result,  if optionfees for this chain are less than params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain,then some optionfees will be stuck in the contract as those option fees are out of the accounting mechanism. Similarly, if optionfees for this chain are greater  than params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain, then some option fee will be extra in the accounting of totalOptionFeesInThisChain and those some option fees will be taken from totalCdsDepositedAmount. As a result, there may remain less totalCdsDepositedAmount than expected which may lead to depositors can’t withdraw cds deposited amount.




### Root Cause

 optionfees from this chain(params.optionFees - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain)  should be deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees but params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain is deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees in the  function withdrawUser.

### Attack Path

1. let’s assume, currently omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount = 1000, omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees = 1050, totalCdsDepositedAmount in this chain = 400, totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees in this chain = 425. So otherChainCDSAmount = 1000-400 = 600,  totalOptionFeesInOtherChain = 1050-425-600 = 25, totalOptionFeesInThisChain =25, share of other chain = 600/1000 = 0.6, 

2. a user(alice’s ) withdraws her cds deposited amount, so function withdrawUser is called where alice’s   params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = 100, params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount = 50,  params.optionFees = 5(this is just for example), so  params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain = share of other chain*params.optionFees = 0.6*5 = 3, so optionfees for this chain = 5-3 = 2.

3. see the function withdrawUser where  totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees is update incorrectly i.e params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain is deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees(optionfees for this chain should be deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees). as a result,  now totalOptionFeesInThisChain = 25-3 = 22(which is incorrect accounting) because this chain has 23 optionfess(as optionfees for this chain = 5-3 = 2).so 1 option fees will be stuck in the contract as 1 option fee is out of accounting mechanism.

4. similarly, if params.optionFees = 5, params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain = 2,  optionfees for this chain = 5-2 = 3. Then currently totalOptionFeesInThisChain will be 25-2 = 23(which is incorrect accounting) because this chain has 22 optionfess(as optionfees for this chain = 5-2 = 3). So 1 option fee will be extra in the accounting of totalOptionFeesInThisChain and this 1 option fee will be taken from totalCdsDepositedAmount. As a result, there may remain less totalCdsDepositedAmount than expected which may lead to depositors can’t withdraw cds deposited amount.

### Impact

 if optionfees for this chain are less than params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain,then some optionfees will be stuck in the contract as those option fees are out of the accounting mechanism. Similarly, if optionfees for this chain are greater  than params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain, then some option fee will be extra in the accounting of totalOptionFeesInThisChain and those some option fees will be taken from totalCdsDepositedAmount. As a result, there may remain less totalCdsDepositedAmount than expected which may lead to depositors can’t withdraw cds deposited amount.


### PoC

### Mitigation

optionfees from this chain(params.optionFees - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain)  should be deducted from totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees.
