# Users can artificially inflate the cumulative/interest rate

### Summary

The `calculateCumulativeRate` function is a public function that allows updating the current interest/cumulative rate. The issue is that when calling it independently the last event time is not updated to the current time, thus malicious users can accumulate interest for the same time period multiple times.

### Root Cause

In `calculateCumulativeRate` `lastEventTime` is not set to `block.timestamp`. As a result, users can call it multiple time, accumulating the interest rate for the same time period multiple times.

### Attack Path

1. The `lastEventTime` is set to `block.timestamp - 1 days`.
2. Malicious user calls `calculateCumulativeRate` 10 times.
3. As a result, the accrued interest rate for that day will be 10 times more than it should be.
4. This will cause borrowers to have to pay much higher debts than they should.

### Impact

Malicious users can force borrowers to pay significantly higher debts than they should. Furthermore, by calling it for a great number of times, borrowers will become completely unable to repay their debt.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Update `lastEventTime` to the current timestamp when `calculateCumulativeRate` is called.
