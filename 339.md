# totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees are not updated/increased in the function deposit(BorrowLib.sol) but only  omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees are increased/updated  in the function deposit(BorrowLib.sol).

### Summary

 see the  function deposit(BorrowLib.sol) where only  omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees are increased/updated but  totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees are not updated/increased. As a result, the total option fees( for this chain/market) will be stuck in the treasury contract as those are out of the accounting mechanism.Similarly, other chains/markets cds contract’s option fees will be stuck and the whole accounting mechanism will be broken. 



### Root Cause

totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees are not updated/increased in the function deposit(BorrowLib.sol) but only  omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees are increased/updated  in the function deposit(BorrowLib.sol).

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, after multiple depositing usda to cds (in all chain/market), omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount = 1000 and omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees = 1050(where this chain’s[assume chain1/market1] fees are 10 and other chain’s fees are 40).

2. after multiple depositing usda to cds to this chain(chain1/market1),  totalCdsDepositedAmount = 500 and totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees is also 500 in this chain1/market1 because collected option fees are not updated/increased in the  function deposit(BorrowLib.sol) for this chain1/market1.

3.  see the function deposit(BorrowLib.sol), here collected option fees are only updated/increased globally i.e  omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees += optionFees; but this function does not update/increase option fees of cds depositor for this chain1/market1 i.e  totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees(for this market1/chain1).

4. so, totalCdsDepositedAmount(500) and totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees(500) will always be the same in the cds for this chain1/market1.

5. as a result, when the   function withdrawUser(CDSLib) is called in the cds(for this chain1/market1), total option fees will be taken from other chains( when option fees in this chain is 0, then whole param.optionfees are taken from other chains     ).

6. so the total option fees(10 option fees for this chain1/market1) will be stuck in the treasury contract as those are out of the accounting mechanism

7. see  function withdrawUser, assume params.optionFees = 5, so  params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain will also be 5, so totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees is updated in this way i.e totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= (params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount + (params.optionFees - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain)); if params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount =100 and currently  totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees = 500. So now totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees will be 400(because 500-= 100+(5-5) =400)  and totalCdsDepositedAmount will also be 400. So those option fees(for chain1/market1) will be out of the accounting mechanism and will be stuck in the treasury contract.

8. Similarly, other chains/markets cds contract’s option fees will be stuck and the whole accounting mechanism will be broken.

### Impact

 the total option fees( for this chain/market) will be stuck in the treasury contract as those are out of the accounting mechanism.Similarly, other chains/markets cds contract’s option fees will also be stuck and the whole accounting mechanism will be broken. 



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees should be updated/increased in the function deposit(BorrowLib.sol).
