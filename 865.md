# issues with calculateRatio: Incorrect Data Usage

### Summary

The function **calculateRatio** takes seven arguments, and we should focus on **latestTotalCDSPool**. This variable is calculated as `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount - omniChainData.downsideProtected,` representing the real total CDS amount.

The problem arises in line 213, where the **currentCDSPoolValue** is calculated using **previousData.cdsPoolValue** instead of the latest value, **latestTotalCDSPool**. As a result, the ratio calculated in line 218 is based on the incorrect **currentCDSPoolValue**, which does not account for the subtraction of **omniChainData.downsideProtected**. This could lead to an incorrect ratio calculation.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L213
in borrowlib line  213 **currentCDSPoolValue** is calculated with the old value
