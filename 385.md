# MasterPriceOracle.sol does not validate minAnswer/maxAnswer of Chainlink aggregator on Optimism.

### Summary

minAnswer/maxAnswer of Chainlink aggregator on Optimism is not validated. 

### Root Cause

The issue occurs because Chainlink oracles, upon which MasterPriceOracle.sol relies on Optimisim chain, have built-in minimum price limitations. If an asset's value experiences a severe drop below this minimum, the oracle will continue reporting the minimum price, even though it's no longer accurate.
This discrepancy can lead to code executions based on outdated or incorrect price data. As a result, users or the protocol may experience potential financial losses.

The ETH/USD feed on Optimism relies on the aggregator that has the minAnswer/maxAnswer checks. 
Feed address: 0x13e3Ee699D1909E989722E753853AE30b17e08c5
Aggregator address: 0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9
