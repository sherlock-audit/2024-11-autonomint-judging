# Users can withdraw liquidated collateral

### Summary

If a user gets liquidated through `liquidationType2` they will still be able to withdraw their collateral and repay their debt as `depositDetail.liquidated` is not set to true. This is problematic as the collateral will have already been sent to Synthethix, and the collateral that the liquidated user withdraws will most likely be taken from the collateral of other users.

Furthermore, the necessary liquidation state changes performed in `liquidationType1` are omitted in the second type:

This is problematic as numerous parts of the protocol are reliant on this values, for example the CDS cumulative value which determines the profits/losses of CDS depositors.

### Root Cause

In borrowLiquidation.liquidationType2 `depositDetail.liquidated` is not set to true.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user gets liquidated through `liquidationType2` and their collateral gets transferred to Synthetix.
2. Even though they have been liquidated they can still withdraw their collateral as no state changes have been made to their deposit.

### Impact

Liquidated users can withdraw their collateral. If that occurs the withdrawn collateral will be taken from the deposits of other borrowers.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Perform the appropriate state changes when `liquidationType2` gets called.
