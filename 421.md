# BorrowLib::borrowerDebt will be computed based on stale cumulative rate

### Summary

`BorrowLib::borrowerDebt` will be computed based on stale cumulative rate 

### Root Cause

```solidity
borrowDebt = normalizedAmount * lastCumulativeRate
normalizedAmount = tokensToMint / lastCumulativeRate
interest = borrowDebt - borrowedAmount
```
as we can see the protocol uses delta between lastCumulativeRate at depositing time and lastCumulativeRate at withdrawal time to compute interest but lastCumulativeRate wouldn't update at withdrawal time

### PoC

**Textual PoC:**
Let's assume ratePerSec is 2
1-userA deposits 1 ETH and get 800 usda as loan and because noOfBorrowers is zero currentCumulativeRate for userA is 2
2-userB deposits 1 ETH and get 800 usda as loan 5 second after userA
currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * (ratePerSec ^ timeInterval)
currentCumulativeRate= 2 * (2 ^ 5) = 64
3-userA withdraw her/his collateral 5 seconds after userB but borrowDebt will be computed based on lastCumulativeRate = 64 which isn't correct
correct value is 64 * (2 ^ 5) =4096

### Impact

loss of funds for protocol

### Mitigation

Consider to update lastCumulativeRate before computing borrowDebt
