# User can prevent the liquidation of his own position

### Summary

User can prevent the liquidation of his own position by force-reverting `liquidateBorrowPosition()`.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L302-L305)

ETH will be sent to users address during `liquidationType1()` call if `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` = 0. The issue is that user can force-revert liquidation by adding `revert` keyword in his `receive()` function, thus creating non-liquidatable position:
```solidity
 if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

`liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` = 0
Issue will happen if other chain dont have any available liquidation amount.

```solidity
  // if tha other chain dont have any available liquidation amount
        if (totalAvailableLiqAmountInOtherChain == 0) {
            liqAmountToGet = 0;
        } else {
            //...
        }
        return liqAmountToGet;
```

### Attack Path

User might be an address that cannot accept ETH, or user can modify his `receive()` to revert anytime when contract receives ETH.

### Impact

User can create unliquidateable positions and make protocol accrue bad debt.

### Mitigation

Do not allow to make unsafe calls to user's address.
