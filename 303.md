# Unchecked Oracle Return Values Could Lead to Price Manipulation in `liquidate()`

## Summary:
The code doesn't validate the return values from `getUSDValue()`. By using tuple destructuring and only capturing the second value `ethPrice`, it silently ignores potential failures in the price feed which could lead to price manipulation or incorrect liquidations.

## Vulnerability Details:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L388

```solidity
(, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[AssetName.ETH]);
```

The issues are:
- No validation if the price returned is 0
- No validation if the price feed is stale
- Ignores the first return value which might contain important status information
- No checks for price manipulation through flash loans or other attack vectors

## Impact
1. Liquidation Attacks
- If price feed fails, ethPrice could be 0
- Could trigger incorrect liquidations
- Attackers could exploit price feed failures

2. Financial Loss
- Incorrect collateral valuations
- Wrong liquidation amounts
- Protocol or user losses

## PoC:

1. Victim has deposited 1 ETH as collateral when ETH price was $2000
2. Oracle price feed fails and returns 0
3. Attacker calls liquidate() function
4. Contract uses the zero price without validation
5. Position is incorrectly liquidated despite being healthy
6. Attacker profits from the liquidation

Calculation:
// Original position value
Initial collateral = 1 ETH
Initial ETH price = $2000
Position value = 1 * $2000 = $2000

// After price manipulation
Manipulated ETH price = $0
New position value = 1 * $0 = $0

// Result
Position gets liquidated
Attacker can acquire the collateral at no cost

## Recommendation:
1. Always validate oracle return values
2. Add price sanity checks
3. Implement circuit breakers for extreme price movements
4. Consider using multiple price feeds for critical operations
Add staleness checks for price data
5. Implement price deviation thresholds
