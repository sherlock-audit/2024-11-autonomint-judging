# Withdraw signatures can be replayed, allowing users to withdraw more funds than they should be able to

### Summary

When users withdraw through CDS.sol or borrowing.sol first they must provide a valid signature from the owner. The issue is that in both cases the signature can be replayed, thus allowing users to use the same signature for multiple withdraws.

### Root Cause

In the `CDS._verify` function the signature validation is insufficient and does not prevent users from replaying it. There is a nonce parameter when assets are withdrawn from CDS, however it is also not implemented in a way to prevent the issue.

### Attack Path

1. User withdraw a small deposit from CDS.
2. As the deposit is small `excessProfitCumulativeValue` is set to a minor value and they receive a signature from the owner.
3. After that they withdraw a much greater deposit with the same `excessProfitCumulativeValue`.
4. Now they can reuse the same signature from the first withdraw, even if the `excessProfitCumulativeValue` allowed by the owner would have been higher.

### Impact

Users can replay withdraw signatures in order to receive more profits from their deposits by withdrawing with a lower `excessProfitCumulativeValue` then what should be allowed.

### Mitigation

Implement sufficient signature validation, perhaps by including the deposit index in the signature hash.
