# when `borrowing.sol::depositTokens` is called, stale `lastCumulativeRate` is being passed to `BorrowLib.deposit()` function.

### Summary

When a user calls `borrowing.sol::depositTokens` it will call `BorrowLib.deposit()` with `lastCumulativeRate` as one of it's parameter, but since the `lastCumulativeRate` has been updated when the contract was deployed (`@1`). If a user calls `borrowing.sol::depositTokens` after very long time, the `lastCumulativeRate` being passed as parameter for `BorrowLib.deposit()` will be very old. This will lead to wrong `totalNormalizedAmount` calculation (`@2`).

`@1`
DeployBorrowing.s.sol
```js
    contractsA.borrow.calculateCumulativeRate();
    contractsB.borrow.calculateCumulativeRate();
```

`@2`
borrowing.sol::depositTokens
```js
    totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
        BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
            LTV,
            APR,
            lastCumulativeRate,
            totalNormalizedAmount,
            exchangeRate,
            ethPrice,
            lastEthprice
        ),
```

Also the same issue exist if the duration between 2 calls to `borrowing.sol::depositTokens` is very large.

### Root Cause

Use of stale `lastCumulativeRate`.

### Attack Path

### Impact

`totalNormalizedAmount` is a state variable in `borrowing.sol` , wrong value assignment can lead to -

1. `totalNormalizedAmount` is being used in `_withdraw()` function of `borrowing.sol`, this can lead incorrect
withdrawal amount, code snippet `@3`. potential loss of user funds.

`@3`
borrowing.sol::_withdraw
```js
    BorrowWithdraw_Result memory result = BorrowLib.withdraw(
        depositDetail,
        BorrowWithdraw_Params(
            toAddress,
            index,
            ethPrice,
            exchangeRate,
            withdrawTime,
            lastCumulativeRate,
            totalNormalizedAmount,
            bondRatio,
            collateralRemainingInWithdraw,
            collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw
        ),
        Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options)
    );
```

### PoC

### Mitigation

In `borrowing.sol::depositToken` call `calculateCumulativeRate();` before `BorrowLib.deposit()`-

```js
    totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
        BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
            LTV,
            APR,
            lastCumulativeRate,
            totalNormalizedAmount,
            exchangeRate,
            ethPrice,
            lastEthprice
        ),
```

By calling `calculateCumulativeRate();` early; `lastCumulativeRate` will be updated and the param being passed to `BorrowLib.deposit()` will be latest.
