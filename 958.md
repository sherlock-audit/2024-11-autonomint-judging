# Replay of EIP-712 Signatures Due to Missing Persistent Nonce Check

### Summary

The missing persistent nonce check in _verify() will cause a replay attack for signers as an attacker will reuse the same **(excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, signature)** multiple times.

### Root Cause

In [CDS.sol: _verify()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L282-L285) and [_verify](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L878-L917), there is a nonce passed to the EIP-712 signature, but no on-chain storage tracks whether that nonce has been used. The contract never marks a nonce as consumed.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Admin (or any privileged role that signs) needs to submit a valid signature with (**excessProfitCumulativeValue**, **nonce**).
- **Nonce** is not recorded in a usedNonce mapping (or similar structure).
- The contractâ€™s logic must allow repeated calls to _verify() with identical parameters.

### External pre-conditions

The attacker can observe or intercept the valid signature broadcast to the network (e.g., via mempool).

### Attack Path

- Admin signs (**excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce**) once, producing signature.
- Attacker sees the transaction in the mempool, copies (nonce, signature).
- Attacker calls the same function _verify() with the same (**excessProfitCumulativeValue**, nonce, signature) to replay the action multiple times, as the contract never marks nonce used.

### Impact

The protocol could suffer repeated unauthorized actions (e.g., additional withdrawals, repeated approvals, or destructive admin-level operations) using the same signature.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Track Used Nonces in On-Chain Storage

 
 
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public usedNonce;
 ```
 
```solidity
require(!usedNonce[signer][nonce], "Signature replay");
usedNonce[signer][nonce] = true;
```

- Single-Use Off-Chain Signatures

If the system design does not allow on-chain tracking, enforce ephemeral usage: a signature is only valid for an immediate transaction, not to be reused.

- Nonce Incrementation

Use strictly monotonic counters (nonce++) in on-chain storage, so that each new EIP-712 message has a higher nonce.
