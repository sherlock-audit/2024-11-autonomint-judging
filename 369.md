# Core functions can be DoS-ed, which will lead to loss of funds for CDS owners

### Summary

A malicious user can permanently DoS several crutial functions in `borrowing` and `CDS` contracts, also this will incur loses to CDS owners, since no one would be able to withdraw his funds.

### Root Cause

The root is in the `CDS::updateDownsideProtected()` function: 

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829-L831

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L324

```javascript
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```

This function should be called only by the borrowing contract, but as can be seen above anyone can call this function and increment the downside protected variable to a large number. The problem is that the `downsideProtected` variable is utilised in deposit and withdraw functions in the CDS module to get the total deposited funds in the contract: 

```javascript
 function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
            totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }

CDS::deposit():

function deposit(...) public payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(4)) {
        ...

        // updating totalCdsDepositedAmount by considering downsideProtected
        _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount();

        ...
    }

CDS::withdraw():

function withdraw(...) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
        ...

        // updating totalCdsDepositedAmount by considering downsideProtected
        _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount();  
        ...  
```

So everytime these two functions are called, the `downsideProtected` amount will be subtracted from the total deposits, which will revert the calls everytime. Additionally this variable is used in `CDS::getTotalCdsDepositedAmount(), getTotalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees()` getter functions, which are called in `CDS::calculateCumulativeRate`, but this function is callable only by the borrowing contract, if we follow the track cumulative rate is called in `BorrowLib::renewOptions(), deposit()`. This means these two functions will be unaccessable also.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Simply a malicious user can call `CDS::updateDownsideProtected()` with `type(uint128).max` as parameter for example, thus the `downsideProtected` variable will be a huge number. And since this variable only increments and resets only after the subtractions, no one can prevent this attack. Hence it leads to permanent DoS + loss of funds for CDS owners.

### Impact

Permanent Dos of the following functions:
- `CDS::deposit()`
- `CDS::withdraw()`
- `borrowing::renewOptions()`
- `borrowing::deposit()`, which serves as one of the entry-points to the protocol

Additionally since withdraw in CDS contract, can't be invoked users will lose their funds

- Severity: DoS + loss of funds for users who deposit in CDS module = `High`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control or change the visibility of `CDS::updateDownsideProtected()`
