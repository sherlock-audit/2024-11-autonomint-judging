# Malicious user will inflate/deflate `previousData.cdsPoolValue` as it pleases, DoSing withdrawals or bypassing 20% ratio

### Summary

[borrowing::depositTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L226) does not update `lastEthprice`, allowing anyone to call it any number of times in a loop with dust deposits to increase/decrease `previousData.cdsPoolValue` in [BorrowLib::calculateRatio()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L661), depending on the price diff (positive increases, negative decreases).

If the price diff is positive, it can be inflated to a huge number, such that the ratio will always be bigger than `20%`, but it doesn't actually have the USDa backing, breaking a key invariant of the protocol:
> New Borrows cannot mint new stablecoin if cds/borrow ratio is below 0.2 and cds users cannot withdraw. 

Additionally, if the price diff is negative, it can be used to move it to 0, disabling cds withdrawals as the ratio will be too low.

### Root Cause

In `borrowing::depositTokens()`, `lastEthPrice` is not updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user calls `borrowing::depositTokens()` in a loop, inflating/deflating cdsPoolValue as they wish.

### Impact

Borrows are enabled with less than 20% actual ratio or cds withdrawals are DoSed.

### PoC

See links.

### Mitigation

Update last eth price.
