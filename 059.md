# For CDS withdraw we don't link a signature to a specific address, which leads to nonce not being able to be distinguished

### Summary
When doing a **CDS withdraw** we perform signature verification in `CDS.sol` in `verify()`, however, there isn't an address that's passed in, so anyone could use signatures from anyone else and potentially get better `excessProfitCumulativeValue`. 

### Root Cause

Not having an address linked to a signature, will result in DoS due to signature frontrunning. Also, anyone could use the signatures of others, which have better `excessProfitCumulativeValue`.
Reference [CDS.sol#L878-L916](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L878-L916)
```solidity
    function _verify(FunctionName functionName, uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue, uint256 nonce,  bytes memory odosExecutionData,  bytes memory signature) private view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 digest;
        if (functionName == FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW) {
            digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        keccak256(
                            "Permit(uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,uint256 nonce)"
                        ),
                        excessProfitCumulativeValue,
 @>>                   nonce  // We only pass nonce
                    )
                )
            );
        } else if (functionName == FunctionName.BORROW_WITHDRAW) {
....
        }

        address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
        bytes32 hashedSigner = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(signer));
        if (hashedSigner == hashedAdminTwo) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
```

### Attack Path
1. User A intends to make a withdrawal.
2. User B can front-run User A by capturing their signature and withdrawing User A's position. This would result in a revert, as nonce checks would fail. (It should be noted that currently nonces are not checked, which is a separate issue, and fixing that would not resolve this issue due to a different root cause.)
```solidity
        uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn(
            msg.sender,
            index,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
@>>         excessProfitCumulativeValue
        ) - 1;
```


### Impact
- Adversary can front-run Users and DoS their ability to withdraw.
- Adversary could get a better excessProfitCumulativeValue from another user, by frontrunning it.

### Mitigation
Pass an address and verify it in the signature.
