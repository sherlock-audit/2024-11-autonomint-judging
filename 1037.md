# Missing Cancellation Mechanism for Failed Synthetix Delayed Orders Leads to Stuck Liquidations and Locked Margin

### Summary

The protocol's integration with Synthetix for Type 2 liquidations lacks error handling and cancellation mechanisms for failed delayed orders. When order execution fails, there is no way to cancel the order and recover the margin, leading to stuck orders and locked funds


### Root Cause

The `executeOrdersInSynthetix` function, which attempts to execute delayed orders on Synthetix, lacks error handling mechanisms or fallback logic to manage failed executions.
```js
function executeOrdersInSynthetix(
    bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData
) external onlyBorrowingContract {
    synthetixPerpsV2.executeOffchainDelayedOrder{value: 1}(address(this), priceUpdateData);
}
```
This function makes a direct call to Synthetix without any `try-catch` block.
When the `executeOffchainDelayedOrder` is called, the function can revert due to a number of reasons (as per Synthetic's interface):
[https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/de2b994cc8064301288e7619042287cddb7c6753/contracts/PerpsV2MarketDelayedExecution.sol#L91-L104](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/de2b994cc8064301288e7619042287cddb7c6753/contracts/PerpsV2MarketDelayedExecution.sol#L91-L104)
```js
Reverts if:
     * - There is no order
     * - Target roundId wasn't reached yet
     * - Order is stale (target roundId is too low compared to current roundId).
     * - Order fails for accounting reason (e.g. margin was removed, leverage exceeded, etc)
     * - Time delay and target round has not yet been reached
```
If the `executeOffchainDelayedOrder` call reverts due to conditions outlined in Synthetix's interface, the protocol does not handle the failure.

As per Synthetix's documentation, failed orders must be manually cancelled using the `cancelDelayedOrder` function:
```js
function cancelDelayedOrder(address account) external;
```
However, the protocol does not invoke `cancelDelayedOrder` for failed executions, leaving funds locked and orders stuck in the system.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Type 2 liquidation has been initiated
2. Protocol has:
    - Converted collateral through ETH->WETH->sETH->sUSD path
    - Transferred margin to Synthetix
    - Submitted delayed order via `submitOffchainDelayedOrder`
3. Order execution is attempted via `executeOrdersInSynthetix`


### External pre-conditions

1. One or more of Synthetix's order execution conditions highlighted in root cause are not met

### Attack Path

1. Type 2 liquidation process reaches order execution phase
2. executeOrdersInSynthetix is called
3. Order execution fails due to Synthetix conditions
4. No error handling occurs
5. No cancellation is attempted
6. Order remains in Synthetix system
7. Margin remains locked
8. Protocol has no mechanism to:
      Detect failure
      Cancel order
      Recover margin
      Reset liquidation state

### Impact

Failed order executions in Type 2 liquidations lead to permanently locked margin in Synthetix and stuck orders that cannot be cancelled. This not only locks user funds but also prevents the protocol from properly liquidating underwater positions, potentially leading to bad debt accumulation during market volatility.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address the issue:

1. Introduce a `try-catch` block around the `executeOffchainDelayedOrder` call to detect and handle execution failures.
2. Upon failure, invoke the `cancelDelayedOrder` function to remove the stuck order and recover the locked margin.
