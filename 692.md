# `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` is incorrectly updated when withdrawing from borrowing.sol

### Summary

When withdrawing from the `borrowing.sol` contract `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` is decremented by `depositDetail.depositedAmount` instead of `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`. This is an issue as the `depositedAmount` represents the underlying asset, and not ETH. As a result, `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` will be incorrectly decremented.

This is problematic as if `depositedAmount` is a number greater than `depositedAmountInETH` `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` may underflow, preventing the user from withdrawing their assets. Furthermore, `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` is used in several criticial parts of the protocol.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib._withdraw:920 `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` is decreased by `depositDetail.depositedAmount`, which is the deposited asset amount and not the deposited asset amount converted to ETH.

### Attack Path

Here is one possible scenario:
1. User deposits 1e18 of wrsETH, which when converted to ETH is 0.9e18.
2. Upon the deposit 0.9e18 is added to `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei`.
3. After some time the user makes a withdrawal.
4. Instead of decreasing `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` by 0.9e18, it is decreased by 1e18, causing a revert.

### Impact

Users may be unable to withdraw their collateral. Furthermore, `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` is used when calculating the CDS cumulative rate, thus if it is wrongly updated CDS depositors may have lower/higher profits/losses. Also, it is used when calculating the ratio of the CDS pool value to the ETH value, which if calculated wrongly may fail to correctly check whether the CDS has enough funds to give downside protection to borrowers.

### PoC

### Mitigation

In BorrowLib._withdraw:920 decrease `omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` by `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`.
