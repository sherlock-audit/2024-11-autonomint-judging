# `lastEventTime` gets updated wrongly during withdraw of collateral

### Summary

`lastEventTime` gets updated wrongly during withdraw of collateral

### Attack Path

- During withdraw of collateral , _withdraw() gets called
- `lastEventTime` variable gets updated before `calculateCumulativeRate()` gets called.
- Due to this wrong update of variable the bug occurs.
- As lastEventTime has been updated earlier than calculateCumulativeRate, lastEventTime it would be current block.timestamp
`lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);`
- While calculating cumulativeRate from BorrowLib.sol
```solidity
function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        // If there is no borrowers in the protocol
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            // current cumulative rate is same as ratePeSec
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Find time interval between last event and now
    @>      uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            //calculate cumulative rate
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
- While calculating, timeInterval would be zero as lastEventTime is set as current block.timestamp so timeInterval would become zero.
- As timeInterval becomes zero everytime currentCumulativeRate would not be updated correctly and would always return value with previous CumulativeRate.
- Everytime the user would be charged less interest rate as currentCumulativeRate does not get updated properly and does not accrue interest from the last updated `lastEventTime`

### Impact

- `uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;`
- Everytime the above value comes to zero while withdraw() because of this interest paid by user would be less as the interest doesn't get accrue from lastEventTime and whenever withdraw() gets called timeInterval would come zero as lastEventTime gets updated before calculating cumulative Rate.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Update lastEventTime after calculating cumulative rate as done in deposits.
```solidity
calculateCumulativeRate();
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);
```
