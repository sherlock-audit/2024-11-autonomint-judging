# Not denominating updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts in ETH

 ### Summary 
When calling `updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts()` on the Treasury we are not submitting the amount denominated in 1 currency ( ETH ), which leads to inaccuracy.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L667-L670
In CDSLib.sol during withdrawing of position, when calling `updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts()` there is a flaw.
```solidity
                interfaces.treasury.updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts(
                    weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) / params.weETH_ExchangeRate) + rsETHAmount
                        - ((rsETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) / params.rsETH_ExchangeRate)
                );
```
We are trying to sum `(weETHAmount - X) + (rsETHAmount - Y)`. However wETH and rsETH have different exchange rates, thus this will lead to inaccuracy.

### Impact
inaccurately calling updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts with over/under inflated values.
                
### Mitigation
Denominate both in ETH.
