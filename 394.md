# `borrowing::redeemYields` does not work as intended and can damage the user calling it

### Summary

`borrowing::redeemYields` burns ABOND from the `msg.sender` instead of the specified user as mentioned by the code comments. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L314

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib::1032` the function `burnFromUser` is called with `msg.sender` instead of `user`

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `redeemYields` with Bob's address.
2. Bob receives the yield but Alice pays with her own ABONDS instead of Bob

### Impact

Unintended behavior which leads to the protocol believing that certain users own ABONDS but they do not vice versa. Function calls may revert and users can loose their ABONDS accidentally.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Burn the tokens from `user` instead of the `msg.sender`.
