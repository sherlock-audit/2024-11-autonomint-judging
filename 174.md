# Lack of Borrow Size Check Leading to Potential DOS

### Summary

The borrowing contract does not enforce a minimum borrow size, allowing users to create many small loans. These small loans can complicate the liquidation process and potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) when CDS users attempt to withdraw, due to unbounded loops processing numerous liquidations.

### Root Cause

The lack of a minimum borrow size check allows users to create numerous small loans, making them difficult to track and liquidate efficiently.

Additionally, liquidating these small positions can pose a potential DoS risk for CDS users. When a user with a significant deposit withdraw their liquidation gains, the withdrawal process involves looping through and processing all accumulated liquidations. If numerous small liquidations have occurred, the liquidation index increases substantially, requiring many iterations during withdrawal. This can cause the withdrawal process to exceed the block gas limit, failing the withdrawal

```solidity
    function withdrawUser(
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
            uint128 liquidationIndexAtDeposit = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationindex;
            // If the number of liquidations is greater than or equal to liquidationIndexAtDeposit
            if (
                params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations >=
                liquidationIndexAtDeposit
            ) {
                // Loop through the liquidations that were done after user enters
                for (uint128 i = (liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1); i <= params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations; i++) {
                    uint128 liquidationAmount = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user creates many small loans without a minimum borrow size.
2. These small loans are difficult to liquidate due to their low collateral value.
3. Protocol still liquidate this positions increasing liquidation index
4. When a CDS user with a high amount tries to withdraw, the system processes all liquidations in an unbounded loop.
5. The loop can exceed the block gas limit, leading to a denial of service.


### Impact

Difficulty in tracking and liquidating small loans.
Potential denial of service when CDS users withdraw due to unbounded loops processing numerous liquidations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a minimum borrow size check to prevent the creation of numerous small loans
