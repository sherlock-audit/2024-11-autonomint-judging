# `redeemYields` `user` parameter discrepancy

### Summary

In the `redeemYields` function of borrowing.sol the user can specify a user parameter. Currently that user parameter will receive the redeemed yields, whilst the necessary ABOND tokens will be burned from the callers address. The issue is that even though no tokens are burned from the user address it is still checked that the user has enough ABOND tokens for the redeem.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.redeemYields it is validated that the `user` parameter has enough ABOND tokens even though no ABOND tokens will be burned from `user`. As the point of the `user` parameter is to only receive the redeemed yields, this is likely to cause `redeemYields` to revert as it is not expected nor necessary for the `user` to own any ABOND.

### Attack Path

1. User redeems ABOND yields and sets a smart contract's address as the `user` in order for the smart contract to receive the yields.
2. The call reverts as the smart contract does not own any ABOND, even though the necessary ABOND tokens will be burned from the address of the `msg.sender` and not the `user`.

### Impact

`redeemYields` will revert in many occasions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It should be checked whether the `msg.sender` has enough ABOND tokens instead of the `user` parameter:

```solidity
        State memory userState = abond.userStates(msg.sender);
        // check user have enough abond
        if (aBondAmount > userState.aBondBalance) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InsufficientBalance();
```
