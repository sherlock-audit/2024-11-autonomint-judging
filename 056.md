# We are wrongly double-calculating the omni-chain cumulativeValue

### Summary
The current logic updates the global `cumulativeValue` during borrowers' and dCDS users' deposits by using the `lastETHPrice` recorded and the `currentETHPrice`. The problem is that there are two different `lastETHPrice` variables on both `Optimism` and `Mode L2` chains, but they essentially update `1` **omnichannel value**.

### Root Cause
An example of when the cumulativeValue is updated (during dCDS deposit) is [CDSLib.sol#L488-L502](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L488C2-L502C11). After it's updated, at the end of the deposit interaction, we send a LayerZero message to update this value.
```solidity
       // Calculate the cumulatice value
@>>     CDSInterface.CalculateValueResult memory result = calculateCumulativeValue(
@>>         params.ethPrice,
@>>         omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount,
@>>         params.lastEthPrice,
            //params.fallbackEthPrice,
            omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei
        );
        // Set the cumulative value
        (omniChainData.cumulativeValue, omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign) = getCumulativeValue(
            result.currentValue,
            result.gains,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValue
        );
```

The calculation of the `calculateCumulativeValue()` function, whose purpose is to calculate the value difference based on the price increase or decrease, is dependent on:
- `totalCdsDepositedAmount` (This is represented in USD and only changes when dCDS users deposit/withdraw. It is the global omnichain value.)
- `priceDiff` - the difference between the last and current recorded ETH price.
- `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` - the total borrowers' collateral in ETH.

The value returned is then used in the `getCumulativeValue()` function, which essentially subtracts or adds the difference in the cumulative value based on whether the price went up or down.

The problem is that the `lastETHPrice` is locally stored in the `dCDS` contracts and is different on both chains. We might account for the same price change twice and change the cumulative value two times with the same delta. This would be highly inconsistent, as the `lastETHPrice` depends on the last interaction on the specific chain, leading to even bigger discrepancies.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. ETH price increases by 20%.
2. A dCDS deposit occurs on chain A, and the `cumulativeValue` is increased based on that 20%. The `lastETHPrice` is stored locally.
3. Chain A syncs with chain B via LayerZero, and now they share the same global `cumulativeValue`.
4. A dCDS deposit occurs on chain B, but its local `lastETHPrice` has not yet been updated. As a result, it increases the `cumulativeValue` again based on the same 20% increase.
5. This results in an incorrect state and a higher `cumulativeValue`.

### Impact

Since `cumulativeValue` tracks the amount accrued to be distributed, the protocol could end up in a situation where it cannot back the assets that need to be distributed by the `cumulativeValue` if it is increased too much. Some users may receive more yield than they should. 

This could also happen in reverse, where a very small `cumulativeValue` results in missed gains. 
- The impact could be significant, as dCDS depositors could lose a substantial portion of their funds when withdrawing.

### Mitigation

Consider reworking the mechanism or tracking the `lastETHPrice` globally. (Tracking `lastETHPrice` globally could introduce other problems, so it is better to consider a way to atomically track the `cumulativeValue`.)
