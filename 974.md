# Vulnerability to Replay Attack  Due to Improper Signature Validation

### Summary

The [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L285) function is vulnerable to replay attacks due to improper signature validation. Specifically, the function does not verify the uniqueness of the nonce or the chain ID, allowing attackers to reuse a valid signature across multiple transactions. This flaw enables malicious actors to repeatedly call the `withdraw` function with the lowest `excessProfitCumulativeValue,` since it's used in 
 `uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;`
I should note the same issue exists in `odosAssembledData` in `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L290` the signature can be replayed even cross chain

### Root Cause

The  `signature` and `excessProfitCumulativeValue` are provided by the user.
The `nonce` parameter is included in the `_verify` function but is not tracked or invalidated after use. This allows the same nonce to be reused with the same signature.
The `_verify` function does not include the `chain ID` in its validation, allowing signatures generated on one chain to be replayed on another chain.
Attackers can repeatedly submit lower values for `excessProfitCumulativeValue,` reducing the protocolâ€™s recorded profits and potentially causing financial discrepancies.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker obtains a valid signature for a specific excessProfitCumulativeValue and nonce.
2. The attacker reuses the signature and nonce to call the withdraw function multiple times.

### Impact

The attacker can repeatedly use a signature related to a low `excessProfitCumulativeValue,` for his own profit.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track nonce usage:
```javascript
mapping(uint256 => bool) public usedNonces;

function _verifyNonce(uint256 nonce) internal {
    require(!usedNonces[nonce], "Nonce already used");
    usedNonces[nonce] = true;
}
```
and include chainId in the verification:
```javascript
The attacker can repeatedly reduce excessProfitCumulativeValue, leading to an inaccurate profit calculation.
```
