# `liquidationType2()` will always due wrong assumption that Asset:sAsset are minted 1:1

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause


The problem is that the developer wrongly [assumes ETH:sETH is minted 1:1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L347-L354) and as such an equivalent amount of `sETH` is received when `wrapper::mint()` was called and as such when `synthetix.exchange()` is called it attempts to transfer more than the amount of `sETH` it actually has to exchange for `sUSD`

```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
324:     function liquidationType2( //@audit SUBMITTED-MED: missing  omnichainData update (sponsor confirmed)
325:         address user,
326:         uint64 index,
327:         uint64 currentEthPrice
328:     ) internal {

/////           .....................

348:    @>   wrapper.mint(amount);
349:         // Exchange sETH with sUSD
350:         synthetix.exchange( 
351:             0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
352:  @>         amount,
353:             0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
354:         );

```

A look at the [`wrapper::mint()`](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x1ea449185ee156a508a4aea2affcb88ec400a95d#code#L1489) function in the `wrapper` contract shows that fee are removed from from the input amount during minting

```solidity
    function mint(uint amountIn) external notPaused issuanceActive {
        ///    ...................

 @>     (uint feeAmountTarget, bool negative) = calculateMintFee(actualAmountIn);
  @>    uint mintAmount = negative ? actualAmountIn.add(feeAmountTarget) : actualAmountIn.sub(feeAmountTarget);

        // Transfer token from user.
        bool success = _safeTransferFrom(address(token), msg.sender, address(this), actualAmountIn);
        require(success, "Transfer did not succeed");

        // Mint tokens to user
 @>     _mint(mintAmount);

        emit Minted(msg.sender, mintAmount, negative ? 0 : feeAmountTarget, actualAmountIn);
    }
```

The amount of sAsset actually received is less minting fees and as such calling `exchange with `amount` will revert

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This can lead to a DOS using `liquidationType2()`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

considering caching the actual balance of sETH received from the `wrapper and use it to call `exchange()`
