# Incorrect Logic in Withdrawal Validation in `treasury`

### Summary

The [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L239) doesn't allow withdrawals


### Root Cause

the validation check in `Withdraw` is incorrect 
```javascript
require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
```
This condition checks if `withdrawed` is `true` before allowing the withdrawal, which is logically incorrect. If `withdrawed` is true, it indicates that the collateral has already been withdrawn, and the function should revert. The current implementation reverses the intended logic.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Since the function is called in the Borrowing contract, this issue puts in jeopardy the whole withdrawal system in Borrowing.
I believe the impact is high as it dos the whole borrowing feature of protocol.


### PoC

Assume the following state:

`depositDetails.withdrawed = false` (the user has not withdrawn yet).
The user has valid collateral details and sufficient balance in the protocol.
Call the withdraw function:
```javascript
withdraw(
    borrowerAddress,
    userAddress,
    1 ether, // Amount to withdraw
    1,       // Exchange rate
    0        // Index
);
```
The require statement fails:
```javascript
require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
```
Since `withdrawed == false`, the function reverts, blocking the withdrawal.


### Mitigation

1- Correct the require Statement:

   Update the condition to ensure that withdrawed == false before allowing the withdrawal:
```javascript
require(!depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
```
2-  Update withdrawed Flag After Successful Withdrawal:

   Ensure the withdrawed flag is updated to true after the first withdrawal to prevent double withdrawals:
```javascript
depositDetails.withdrawed = true;
```
