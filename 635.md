# Missing  Validation for `msg.value` in the `borrowing:depositTokens` function Allows Attacker to Steal Protocol Funds

### Summary

In the borrowing contract `depositTokens` function allows borrowers to deposit collateral `ETH` and mint `USDa` tokens. However, the implementation lacks validation to ensure that the actual ETH sent `msg.value` matches the specified `params.depositingAmount`. This discrepancy could result in unintended behavior, such as using ETH already present in the contract's balance to fulfill the treasury deposit. Consequently, a malicious user might exploit this vulnerability to steal the protocol's funds.


### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the missing validation to compare the `params.depositingAmount` with the `msg.value` provided by the user. When `params.assetName` is ETH, the `params.depositingAmount` is used to determine the amount of ETH deposited to the treasury. However, the actual ETH sent to the contract via `msg.value` is not strictly checked, leading to potential mismatches.

```solidity
        //Call the deposit function in Treasury contract
        ITreasury.DepositResult memory depositResult = interfaces.treasury.deposit{
@>            value: params.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? params.depositingAmount : 0
        }(
            msg.sender,
            libParams.ethPrice,
            uint64(block.timestamp),
            params.assetName,
            params.depositingAmount
        );

### Attack Path


1. A malicious user calls the `depositTokens` function with `params.depositingAmount` set a little high value (e.g., 1e18) but provides a lower `msg.value`.

2. Since the validation of `msg.value` against `params.depositingAmount` is absent, the protocol uses any existing ETH in the contract balance to fulfill the deposit.

3. The attacker repeats this process, gradually depleting the contract's dust ETH balance or misappropriating funds from other users.

### Impact

**Impact**: High, as a user might steal funds from the borrowing contract.  
**Likelihood**: Low. The borrowing contract does not directly accept ETH, but every borrower must transfer ETH for `fee.nativeFee`. If the borrower deposits other tokens as collateral or ETH, they must transfer some ETH/native tokens. Based on this, the value of `fee.nativeFee` is not calculated or fixed. As a result, it is possible for the contract to have some leftover dust ETH remaining.

**Severity**: Medium.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `depositTokens` function to ensure that `msg.value` matches to `params.depositingAmount + fee.nativeFee`. 

Example:

```solidity
        require(msg.value == params.depositingAmount + fee.nativeFee, "Invalid ETH amount sent");  
```
