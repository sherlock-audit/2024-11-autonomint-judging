# legitimate users cannot withdraw their assets from CDS contract

### Summary
legitimate users cannot withdraw their assets from CDS contract

### Root Cause

users can set liquidationAmount when they deposit in CDS contract and max value for that is totalDepositingAmount but those users who sets liquidationAmount equals to totalDepositingAmount cannot withdraw their assets when eth price falls down          
```solidity
if (params.liquidationAmount > totalDepositingAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_LiqAmountExceedsDepositAmount(
                params.liquidationAmount,
                totalDepositingAmount
            );
```

### PoC

return amount refers to depositAmount plus/minus profit or loss and noOfLiquidations refers to number of liquidation in all chains and let's assume
a legitimate user deposits 1000 usda and sets liquidationAmount also 1000 usda and after a while ETH price experinces dropping too much and
noOfLiquidations will be increased in all chains and accordigly many users will be liquidated and then when  legitimate user want to withdraw his/her assets which has been deposited in cds transaction will be reverted because return amount plus liquidation amount is less than initLiquidation amount
```solidity                 
uint256 returnAmountWithGains = params.returnAmount + params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
```

totalDepositingAmount = 1000 usda
params.returnAmount = 850 usda 
params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount = 100 usda after execute loop
returnAmountWithGains = (850 + 100 - 1000) ---> [revert]

**consider to this note noOfLiquidations refers to number of liquidation in all chains**

### Impact
break core funnctions

### Mitigation
consider to don't allow liquidationAmount to be equal with totalDepositingAmount
