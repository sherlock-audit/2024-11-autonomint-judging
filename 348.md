# Anyone Can Renew Any Position with Extraneous Deadlines

### Summary

The borrower position's 20% downside protection can be renewed for an additional 30 days by providing USDa tokens. Users should only be able to renew their positions within a specified validity term (15 to 30 days from the deposit). However, currently, all users can renew at any time at their discretion.

### Root Cause

- [Line 562 of borrowing.sol] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L562)  
- [Line 621 of BorrowLib.sol] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L621)  
- [Lines 446-451 of BorrowLib.sol] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L446-L451)
```solidity
    if (
        block.timestamp <
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
        block.timestamp >
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
    ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
The above condition statement will always return false. It should be structured as follows:
```solidity
    if (
        block.timestamp <
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
        block.timestamp >
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
    ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```

### Impact

Any user can renew their positions at any time at their discretion, which is not an intended design choice.

### Mitigation

The original code:
```solidity
    if (
        block.timestamp <
-       depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
        block.timestamp >
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
    ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
Should be updated to:
```solidity
    if (
        block.timestamp <
+       depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
        block.timestamp >
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
    ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
