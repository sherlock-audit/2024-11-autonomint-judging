# No Sequencer Uptime Verification in Optimism Oracle Price Queries

### Summary

The absence of L2 sequencer status validation will cause a critical oracle reliability issue for borrowers and lenders as users can execute transactions using stale prices during sequencer downtime on Optimism (chain ID 10).


### Root Cause

At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L79  contract explicitly handles Optimism (chain ID 10) but fails to implement sequencer uptime verification:
```solidity
else if (block.chainid == 10) { // Optimism chain
    AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);
    // Get the eth price
    (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
    // ... price processing without sequencer checks ...
}
```
Chainlink provides [apis](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#handling-outages-on-optimism-base-metis-and-scroll) to check sequencer uptime status which are not being used.

### Impact

The protocol and its users could suffer losses up to the total value of transactions executed during sequencer downtime. Specifically:

- Users may execute operations at incorrect prices
- Unfair liquidations may occur
- Incorrect collateral valuations may be accepted
