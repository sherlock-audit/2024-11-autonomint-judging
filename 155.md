# Incorrect Update of totalCdsDepositedAmount on Withdrawal

### Summary

When users deposit to the CDS, the `totalCdsDepositedAmount` is increased by the deposit amount. However, during withdrawal, the totalCdsDepositedAmount is decreased by the user's profit or loss plus the deposit amount. This can lead to an incorrect totalCdsDepositedAmount over time, especially if users are in profit, potentially causing withdrawals to fail and breaking cumulative value calculations.

### Root Cause

When users deposit to CDS totalCdsDepositedAmount is increased as deposit amount. During the withdrawal users return amount changes based on` omniChainData.cumulativeValue`.  In the current logic if CDS users has profits `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount` not updated anywhere. When users withdraw,` cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = currentValue;` includes profit and is higher than the deposit amount. Consequently, `totalCdsDepositedAmount` is decreased by this higher amount. Over time, if we assume depositors are in profit, totalCdsDepositedAmount could become very low due to constant decreases, causing omniChainData.cumulativeValue to be wrongly calculated. This can result in higher return amounts for withdrawals.

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {

        // Calculate current value
        CalculateValueResult memory result = _calculateCumulativeValue(
            omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei,
            omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount,
            ethPrice
        );

        // Set the cumulative vaue
        (omniChainData.cumulativeValue, omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign) = getCumulativeValue(
            omniChainData,
            result.currentValue,
            result.gains
        );

        // Update user deposit data
        cdsDepositDetails.withdrawedTime = uint64(block.timestamp);
        cdsDepositDetails.ethPriceAtWithdraw = ethPrice;
        uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn(
            msg.sender,
            index,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
            excessProfitCumulativeValue
        ) - 1; //? subtracted extra 1 wei
       //@audit new depositedAmount includes profit or loss
        cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = currentValue;
        uint256 returnAmount = cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount + optionFees;

//
}

    function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(
        CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
      
       //@audit more than deposit amount is removed here
        totalCdsDepositedAmount -= params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount;
        totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= params.returnAmount - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain;

        params.omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount -= params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount;
        params.omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= params.returnAmount;

}

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User deposits an amount x to the CDS.
2. The totalCdsDepositedAmount is increased by x.
3. Over time, the user's deposit accrues profit, making the cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount greater than x.
4. When the user withdraws, the totalCdsDepositedAmount is decreased by the cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, which includes the profit.
5. This results in the totalCdsDepositedAmount being lower than expected.
6. Over multiple such transactions, the totalCdsDepositedAmount becomes significantly lower, potentially causing withdrawal failures and incorrect cumulative value calculations.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The incorrect update of totalCdsDepositedAmount can lead to withdrawal failures due to insufficient funds and incorrect cumulative value calculations, leading to inaccurate return amounts.




### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A different logic should be implemented when CDS are in profit to update totalCdsDepositedAmount correctly
