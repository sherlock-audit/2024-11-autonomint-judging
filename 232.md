# The MasterPriceOracle contract employs a constructor for initialization despite inheriting from OpenZeppelin's Initializable

### Summary

The `MasterPriceOracle` contract employs a constructor for initialization despite inheriting from OpenZeppelin's `Initializable` contract to support upgradeability. In upgradeable proxy patterns, constructors are not executed, which leads to critical initialization code being skipped. As a result, essential state variables like `oracles` and `assetAddress` mappings remain uninitialized, causing the contract to malfunction and potentially leading to severe security vulnerabilities.

### Root Cause

The contract is intended to be upgradeable, as indicated by the inheritance from `Initializable`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L17C1-L47C6


```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

contract MasterPriceOracle is Initializable, BasePriceOracle {
    // ...
}
```

However, instead of using an `initialize` function with the `initializer` modifier, the contract uses a constructor:

```solidity
constructor(
    address[] memory underlyings,
    address[] memory _oracles
) {
    // Initialization logic
}
```

In an upgradeable contract using a proxy pattern, the constructor is not called during deployment because the proxy's storage is separate from the implementation contract. Consequently, any initialization code within the constructor is not executed, and state variables are left at their default values.

### Impact

State variables like `oracles` and `assetAddress` mappings remain uninitialized

### PoC

1. **Deploy the Contract via Proxy:**

   Deploy the `MasterPriceOracle` contract using a proxy deployment method (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's Proxy pattern).

2. **State Variables Are Uninitialized:**

   Attempt to read the `oracles` mapping or `assetAddress` mapping:

   ```solidity
   address oracleAddress = masterPriceOracle.oracles(someUnderlyingAddress);
   // oracleAddress will be address(0) due to uninitialized mapping
   ```

3. **Functionality Fails Due to Uninitialized Mappings:**

   Call the `price` function:

   ```solidity
   (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = masterPriceOracle.price(someUnderlyingAddress);
   ```

   Since the `oracles` mapping is empty, the function will revert:

   ```solidity
   if (oracles[underlying] == address(0))
       revert("Price oracle not found for this underlying token address.");
   ```

4. **Security Risks:**

   Uninitialized state variables can lead to unexpected behaviors and security vulnerabilities. For example, attackers might exploit these uninitialized mappings to manipulate contract behavior or cause denial-of-service conditions.

### Mitigation


Replace the constructor with an `initialize` function decorated with the `initializer` modifier. This ensures that the initialization logic executes correctly when the contract is deployed via a proxy.

**Updated Code with Fix:**

```solidity
contract MasterPriceOracle is Initializable, BasePriceOracle {
    /**
     * @dev Initialize state variables.
     * @param underlyings The underlying asset addresses to link to `_oracles`.
     * @param _oracles The `PriceOracle` addresses to be assigned to `underlyings`.
     */
    function initialize(
        address[] memory underlyings,
        address[] memory _oracles
    ) external initializer {
        // Get the total number of collateral addresses
        uint16 noOfUnderlyings = uint16(underlyings.length);

        // Check the number of pricefeed addresses and collateral addresses are the same
        if (noOfUnderlyings != _oracles.length)
            revert Oracle_CollateralAddressesAndPriceFeedIdsMustBeSameLength();

        // Loop through the collateral addresses
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < noOfUnderlyings; i++) {
            // Assign the value (pricefeed address) for the key (collateral address)
            oracles[underlyings[i]] = _oracles[i];
            // Assign the value (collateral address) for the key (collateral name ENUM)
            assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName(i + 1)] = underlyings[i];
        }
    }

    // ... rest of the contract code ...
}
```
