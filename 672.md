# Ineffective Pause Mechanism in `abondToken` and `usda` Due to Missing whenNotPaused Modifier

### Summary

[`abondToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L70) and [`USDa`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/USDa.sol#L97) Implements `pause  and `unpause` functions to restrict functionality during paused states. However, the contract does not use the whenNotPaused modifier (or an equivalent mechanism) to enforce the paused state on other functions. This omission renders the pause mechanism ineffective, as functions can still execute regardless of the paused state.




### Root Cause

The pause and unpause functions update a state variable (e.g., paused) to indicate whether the contract is paused:
```javascript
    function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() public onlyOwner {
        _unpause();
    }
```
However, the contract does not include the `whenNotPaused `modifier or similar checks on other functions to restrict their execution during the paused state:

```javascript
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
    // No check for paused state
    // Function executes even when the contract is paused
}
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Functions continue to execute during the paused state, defeating the purpose of the pause mechanism. Since `abond` is used to retrieve `ETH` from the `treasury`, being unable to pause it when there's an urgency can lead to drain of funds.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement whenNotPaused Modifier:
```javascript
modifier whenNotPaused() {
    require(!paused, "Contract is paused");
    _;
}
```
