# Incorrect Calculation of `borrowingHealth` for Non-ETH Tokens in `BorrowLib::withdraw` will not allow them to withdraw.

### Summary

The `BorrowLib::withdraw` function calculates the `borrowingHealth` as the ratio of the ETH price at the time of deposit to its current price, as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L819). However, this approach is not valid for tokens other than ETH, such as weETH or wrsETH. For non-ETH tokens, `borrowingHealth` should be calculated by comparing the deposited value to the current market value, using their respective exchange rates.

Due to this flaw, users may be unable to withdraw their assets even if the price of non-ETH tokens has remained stable or increased. The protocol only factors in the ETH price drop, which adversely affects the `borrowingHealth` for non-ETH tokens.


### Root Cause

The `borrowingHealth` calculation is solely based on the ETH price and does not take into account the exchange rates or market value of non-ETH tokens like weETH and wrsETH.

` uint128 borrowingHealth = calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, params.ethPrice);`

`if (borrowingHealth < 8000) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The price of ETH decreases by more than 20% from its deposited value.  
- Non-ETH tokens like weETH or wrsETH either maintain a stable price or increase in value in the market.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Even if non-ETH tokens like weETH or wrsETH have performed well in the market, users may be prevented from withdrawing them due to a low `borrowingHealth` value that is influenced solely by the decline in ETHâ€™s price.  

- This miscalculation introduces discrepancies, leading to a negative user experience and potentially eroding trust in the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, ensure that `borrowingHealth` for non-ETH tokens is calculated based on their respective exchange rates instead of relying solely on the ETH price.
