# Incorrect Deadline Validation in Signature Verification

### Summary

Incorrect deadline comparison in signature verification allows expired signatures to be considered valid for the protocol, as the `verify` function in `Borrowing.sol` checks if the deadline is less than the current time, enabling attackers to use outdated signatures.

### Root Cause

In `Borrowing.sol`, the `verify` function incorrectly validates the deadline, accepting signatures where the deadline is less than the current block timestamp.

```solidity
  function verify(
      uint256 deadline,
      bytes memory signature
  ) public view returns (bool) {
      // ...
      if (signer == admin && deadline < block.timestamp) { // Incorrect comparison
          return true;
      } else {
          return false;
      }
  }
  ```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker obtains an expired signature intended for use before a certain deadline.
  2. Due to the incorrect validation, the `verify` function considers the signature valid even after the deadline.
  3. The attacker uses the expired signature to perform unauthorized actions.

### Impact

The protocol may process unauthorized transactions using expired signatures, leading to potential security breaches or financial loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct the deadline validation logic in the `verify` function to `deadline > block.timestamp` to ensure signatures are only valid before their expiration time.
