# Logical Error in Timestamp Condition for Option Renewal `BorrowLib.getOptionFeesToPay()`

### Summary

A logical error exists in the `BorrowLib.getOptionFeesToPay()` function's timestamp condition, which is intended to enforce a renewal window for options. The current implementation uses a logical AND (&&) that results in an impossible condition, potentially leading impossible eligibility check to renew position for users.



### Root Cause

The issue is found in the following code snippet within the `getOptionFeesToPay()` function:

```solidity
            // check the user is eligible to renew position
            if (
                block.timestamp <
@>              depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
                block.timestamp >
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L445C1-L451C57

The condition uses a logical AND (&&), requiring the timestamp to be both less than 15 days and more than 30 days after `optionsRenewedTimeStamp`, which is logically impossible.

This results in the condition never being true, potentially allowing renewals outside the intended window.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the `renewOptions()` function at any time, regardless of the intended renewal window.
2. Due to the logical AND (&&) condition, the check for the renewal window never triggers a revert, as no timestamp can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.
3. The attacker successfully renews the options outside the intended 15 to 30-day window.

### Impact

The intended enforcement of a renewal window is not functioning as expected, allowing renewals at any time. This could lead to unauthorized renewals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the condition to use a logical OR (||) to correctly enforce the renewal window:

```diff
            // check the user is eligible to renew position
            if (
                block.timestamp <
-               depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
+               depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
                block.timestamp >
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
