# protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens

### Summary

Their are several instances in the protocol it fails to account for fee on transfer tokens properly which can lead to incorrect token transfers and potential financial discrepancies. This vulnerability can result in protocol not receiving the expected amount of tokens after the transfer.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the logics where the protocol attempts to transfer usdt which is a fee on transfer token  without considering the possibility of transfer fees. These type of tokens deduct a fee during the transfer, which means the recipient receives less than the specified amount.

```solidity
if (params.usdtAmount != 0 && params.usdaAmount != 0) {
            if (interfaces.usdt.balanceOf(msg.sender) < params.usdtAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_Insufficient_USDT_Balance(); // check if user has sufficient USDa token
            bool usdtTransfer = interfaces.usdt.transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(interfaces.treasury),
                params.usdtAmount
            ); // transfer amount to this contract
            if (!usdtTransfer) revert CDSInterface.CDS_USDT_TransferFailed();
            //Transfer USDa tokens from msg.sender to this contract
            bool usdaTransfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A user initiates a transfer of tokens that have a transfer fee.

The transferFrom function is called to transfer the specified amount of tokens.

Due to the transfer fee, the recipient (treasury) receives less than the specified amount.

The function does not account for the fee, leading to potential discrepancies and financial losses.

### Impact

Protocol may not receive the expected amount of tokens after the transfer, leading to financial discrepancies.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement a mechanism to handle transfer fees

```solidity
if (params.usdtAmount != 0 && params.usdaAmount != 0) {
    if (interfaces.usdt.balanceOf(msg.sender) < params.usdtAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_Insufficient_USDT_Balance(); // check if user has sufficient USDa token
    uint256 initialBalance = interfaces.usdt.balanceOf(address(interfaces.treasury));// cache initial contract balance
    bool usdtTransfer = interfaces.usdt.safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(interfaces.treasury),
        params.usdtAmount
    ); // transfer amount to this contract
    if (!usdtTransfer) revert CDSInterface.CDS_USDT_TransferFailed();
    uint256 finalBalance = interfaces.usdt.balanceOf(address(interfaces.treasury));
    uint256 receivedAmount = finalBalance - initialBalance;// cache final contract balance
    if (receivedAmount < params.usdtAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_USDT_TransferFailed(); // handle transfer fee
    //Transfer USDa tokens from msg.sender to this contract
    bool usdaTransfer = interfaces.usda.safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(interfaces.treasury),
        params.usdaAmount
    );
    if (!usdaTransfer) revert CDSInterface.CDS_USDA_TransferFailed();
}
```
The above logic proper factors fee charges on transfer
