# All signatures signed by hashedAdminTwo might be unusable

### Summary

All signatures signed by `hashedAdminTwo` might be unusable if `hashedAdminTwo` is contract, not EOA.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L909-L915)

During withdrawals from `Borrowing.sol` and `CDS.sol`, function always check that provided signature is signed by `hashedAdminTwo`. 
```solidity
address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
        bytes32 hashedSigner = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(signer));
        if (hashedSigner == hashedAdminTwo) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
```

The problem is `hashedAdminTwo` might be contract, but EIP712 does not work well with smart contracts or wallets:
> Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) can sign messages with their associated private keys, but currently contracts cannot. We propose a standard way for any contracts to verify whether a signature on a behalf of a given contract is valid. This is possible via the implementation of a `isValidSignature(hash, signature)` function on the signing contract, which can be called to validate a signature. [Link](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271)

So while recovering a valid message signed by admin , the return value will be the `bytes4(0)`  because contract that sign messages sticking to the EIP1271 standard use the `EIP1271_MAGIC_VALUE` as the successful return for a properly recovered signature.


### Internal pre-conditions

`hashedAdminTwo` must not be an EOA.

README has no restrictions except for the zero address:
>In CDS.sol
>>setAdminTwo(), setUsdtLimit(), setUSDaLimit() can be called only by Admin and the input can't be zero value.

Also `setAdminTwo` does not check that the address is EOA:
```solidity
function setAdminTwo(bytes32 hashedAddress) external onlyAdmin {
        // Check whether the input address is not a zero address and contract
        if (hashedAddress == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(0)))) revert CDS_CantBeZeroAddress(hashedAddress);
        hashedAdminTwo = hashedAddress;
    }
```
Also admin might not be aware that admin must be EOA:

>Note: if the (external) admin will unknowingly cause issues, it can be considered a valid issue.
>>Example: Admin sets fee to 200%. The issue "Admin can break deposit by setting fee to a 100%+" is invalid as it's common sense that fees can not be more than 100% on a deposit.
>>Example: Admin sets fee to 20%. This will cause liquidations to fail in case the utilization ratio is below 10%, this can be Medium as the admin is not aware of the consequences of his action.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

All withdrawals from `Borrowing.sol` and `CDS.sol` will revert because of incorrect signature.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding contract signature support by implementing a recovery via the suggested `isValidSignature() `function of the `EIP1271`.
