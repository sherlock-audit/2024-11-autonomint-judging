# CDS depositor does not receive native currency excess amount as refund

### Summary

The native tokens will be left in CSD contract and next depositor may provide less eth and use the funds that are in the contract.

### Root Cause

When user is depositing in `CDS`, he should provide enough native funds [to pay for the bridging](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L252-L259) of `globalVariables`:
```solidity
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            IBorrowing.AssetName(0),
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
```
The problem is that there is no mechanism to refund him `fee.nativeFee - msg.value`, if the chain activity has changed and the gas is cheaper when the user submits the tx and calculates the fee for the bridging.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Change of the gas prices for a short period of time.  

### Attack Path

- User deposit CDS on Mode and query `globalVariables.quote`, which returns $0.50 as ETH for `fee.nativeFee`
- User submits the tx, but then sequencer has some downtime and when it is on, the same tx would cost $0.10
- The $0.40 worth of eth are left in the CDN contract and consecutive depositor can use them 

### Impact

Users overpaying for simple operations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider refunding `fee.nativeFee - msg.value` to user, or providing whole `msg.value` to `globalVariables.send`
