# Misconfigured `Abond_Token::transferFrom` allows token theft and unauthorized state changes

### Summary

The  `Abond_Token::transferFrom` updates the state of `msg.sender`  from the state of  `address from` (arbitrary supplied address). A malicious user can exploit this to change his state and cause business logic error.
[FUNCTION](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L147-L170)

```solidity
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;
```

### Root Cause

The state of the `address from` is fetched using `State memory fromState = userStates[from];`, and then the state of `msg.sender` is updated with `userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;`, even though these two addresses may be different.

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        // check the input params are non zero
        require(from != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User");

        // get the sender and receiver state
        State memory fromState = userStates[from];
        State memory toState = userStates[to];

        // update receiver state
        toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value));
        userStates[to] = toState;

        // update sender state
        fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
        userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;

        // transfer abond
        super.transferFrom(from, to, value);
        return true;
    }
```

These values are directly affected by this misconfiguration. 
```solidity
struct State {
    uint256 cumulativeRate;
    uint128 ethBacked;
    uint128 aBondBalance;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

User needs to approve the attacker with a small allowance, as the vulnerable function in question is `transferFrom`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. USER-A approves USER-B with a small amount of allowance 
2. USER-B calls `Abond_Token::transferFrom`  and uses address of `USER-A` in from field to transfer the approved funds.
The fromState holds the values for `USER-A`
```solidity
 fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
```
3. After the debit ,the value of `fromState` will be assigned to `msg.sender`
```solidity
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;
```

### Impact

theft of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change `userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;` to `userStates[from] = fromState;`
