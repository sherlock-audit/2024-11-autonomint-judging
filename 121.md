# Incorrect borrower count and withdrawal issues due to improper flag handling in `treasury` contract

### Summary

The `hasDeposited` flag in the Treasury contract is not reset when a user fully withdraws their collateral. This causes the `borrowerIndex` to increment incorrectly on redeposit and prevents `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` from updating, potentially leading to user withdrawal issues and inaccurate borrower data.

### Root Cause

In `Treasury` contract, the `hasDeposited` flag is not reset to `false` when a user withdraws their entire collateral.

This results in the `borrowerIndex` continuing to increment on redeposit and prevents `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` from incrementing, causing incorrect borrower tracking and potential user withdrawal issues.

If user withdraws whole collateral and deposit again, omniChainData.noOfBorrowers won't be increased.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits collateral and withdraws whole collateral.
2. Attacker deposits and withdraws again. This results decreases `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` because second deposit doesn't increase `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers`.
3. Attacker calls deposit and withdraw repeatly and makes `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` zero.

As result, all users can't withdraw their whole collateral and those are locked. (`omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` is zero, so it reverts.)

### Impact

An attacker can manipulate `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` to zero by repeatedly depositing and withdrawing, causing all users' collateral to become locked and resulting in a denial of service for withdrawals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `Treasury.withdraw` function to set `borrowing[user].hasDeposited` to `false` when the user withdraws their entire collateral. This ensures that a new deposit resets the borrower's index and correctly increments `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers`.
