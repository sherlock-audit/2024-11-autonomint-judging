# User's who have withdrawn or been liquidated can renew their options

### Summary

When `renewOptions()` is called, the `getOptionFeesToPay()` is called to perform some validations. Most notably there is a check to ensure a user who has withdraw or been liquidated cannot renew option

### Root Cause


As shown on L442 below, only and the comment on L441, the renewing user must neither be withdrawn or liquidated

```solidity
File: BorrowLib.sol
431:     function getOptionFeesToPay(
432:         ITreasury treasury,
433:         uint64 index
434:     ) public view returns (uint256) {
435:         // Get the deposit details
436:         ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
437:         ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
438: 
439:         // check if borrowerIndex in BorrowerDetails of the msg.sender is greater than or equal to Index
440:         if (getBorrowingResult.totalIndex >= index) {
441:             // check the position is not withdrew or liquidated
442:     @>        if (depositDetail.withdrawed && depositDetail.liquidated)
443:                 revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyWithdrewOrLiquidated();
444: 

```

The problem is that [the condition or check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L442-L443) for this invariant is not properly implemented thus breaking core protocol invariant and allowing withdrawn or liquidated users to renew 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This
- give the user the liberty of an 80% downside protection even after withdrawal
- breaks core protocol invariant

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `` function as shown below

```diff
File: BorrowLib.sol
