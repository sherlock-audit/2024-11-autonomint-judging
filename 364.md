# Liquidation may be reverted when LTV is high

### Summary

When LTV is high, the liquidation profit may be negative. This will cause liquidation reverted.

### Root Cause

In [BorrowLIb.sol:calculateReturnToAbond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L137), when one borrow position is unhealthy, the admin will liquidate this position. We will spilt 10% profit of liquidation to abond pool.

The problem is that the profit may be negative, this will cause this calculation reverted.
In function calculateReturnToAbond(), `depositedAmount * depositEthPrice` means the deposited Ether USD value. And `returnToTreasury` means the borrowed principle plus borrow interest.
When borrowers borrow USDa, the borrowed USDa amount will be determined by deposited Ether USD value and LTV. According to Automint doc(https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/our-solution), `The LTV (Loan to Value) ratio will start at 80% and will climb upto 100% once the protocol is stabilised.`. When LTV is 100%, then the borrowed USDa amount will equal to deposited Ether USD value.

When we calculate the `calculateReturnToAbond`, this transaction will be reverted because `returnToTreasury` includes borrowed USDa amount and some borrow interest.

```solidity
    function calculateReturnToAbond(
        uint128 depositedAmount, // Here is the depositedAmtInEth.
        uint128 depositEthPrice,
        uint128 returnToTreasury
    ) public pure returns (uint128) {
        return (((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;
    }
```
```solidity
    function tokensToLend(
        uint256 depositedAmount,
        uint128 ethPrice,
        uint8 LTV
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokens = (depositedAmount * ethPrice * LTV) / (USDA_PRECISION * RATIO_PRECISION);
        return tokens;
    }
```
