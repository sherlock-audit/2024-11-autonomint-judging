# when the liquidate function(function liquidationType1) is called vaultvalue(liquidated collateral value) is not decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue. As a result, the cds/borrow ratio will always be less than the real cds/borrow ratio.

### Summary

when the function withdraw(borrowlib.sol) is called, vaultvalue is decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue but when the liquidate function(function liquidationType1) is called vaultvalue(liquidated collateral value) is not decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue. As a result, the cds/borrow ratio will always be less than the actual/real cds/borrow ratio.in some cases, new stable coins should be minted. But as  vaultvalue is not decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue, so ratio(which is incorrect) is below 0.2(),now users can’t mint new stablecoin and cds users can’t withdraw. 


### Root Cause

when the liquidate function(function liquidationType1) is called vaultvalue is not decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue.

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, currently omniChainData.cdsPoolValue = 350,  omniChainData.vaultValue = 2000, so cds/borrow ratio = 350/2000 = 0.175(which is below 0.2, so new stablecoin can’t be minted).

2. now the liquidate function(function liquidationType1) is called where 400(this is just for example) vaultvalue worth of collateral are allocated for cds depositor but 400 vaultvalue is not decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue. See the function withdraw(borrowlib.sol) where vaultvalue is decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue when users withdraw.

3. let’s assume, liquidate amount is 20(this is just for example),so 20 is deducted from omniChainData.cdsPoolValue in liquidateType1 function, so current cds/borrow ratio is 350-20/2000 = 330/2000 = 0.16. But the actual cds/borrow ratio is 330/1600 = 0.206(as currently real omniChainData.vaultValue is = 2000-400 = 1600). 

4.  In the above example, as the cds/borrow ratio becomes 0.206 from 0.175, so new stable coin should be minted. But as  vaultvalue is not decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue, so ratio is below 0.2(0.16),now users can’t mint new stablecoin and cds users can’t withdraw.

### Impact

the cds/borrow ratio will always be less than the actual/real cds/borrow ratio.in some cases, new stable coin should be minted. But as  vaultvalue is not decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue, so ratio(which is incorrect) is below 0.2(),now users can’t mint new stablecoin and cds users can’t withdraw.

### Mitigation

when the liquidate function(function liquidationType1) is called vaultvalue should be  decreased from omniChainData.vaultValue
