# Reuse of Previously Signed excessProfitCumulativeValue in cds.sol::withdraw Function

### Summary

The ``cds.sol::withdraw`` function suffers from insufficient validation of the ``excessProfitCumulativeValue`` and signature arguments, allowing malicious users to reuse previously signed data. This can lead to unauthorized withdrawals and manipulation of the profit calculation to steal funds from the protocol.



### Root Cause

1. **Lack of Nonce Tracking**:

The cds.sol::_verify function verifies the signature authenticity but does not ensure that each signature is unique and used only once.
The protocol lacks a state variable to track and increment the nonce after each verification.
2. **Dynamic and Off-Chain Variables**:

The ``excessProfitCumulativeValue`` and signature are generated off-chain and are expected to be dynamic.
There is no mechanism to prevent users from reusing previously signed data that is no longer valid.
3. **Profit Calculation Exploitation**:

The ``excessProfitCumulativeValue`` is used in the profit calculation formula:
```solidity
uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;
```
Reusing a previously favorable ``excessProfitCumulativeValue`` allows a malicious user to inflate profits.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Unauthorized Profit Gains**:
A malicious user can select and reuse the most favorable excessProfitCumulativeValue from previously signed data to maximize their profit.
- **Loss of Funds for the Protocol**:
The protocol will lose funds as unauthorized profits are withdrawn.

### PoC

- User A initiates a withdrawal with ``excessProfitCumulativeValue1`` and receives a profit based on the signed value.
- User A stores the signed ``excessProfitCumulativeValue1`` and reuses it in a subsequent withdrawal.
- The protocol fails to detect the reused signature, allowing User A to withdraw funds multiple times using the same favorable ``excessProfitCumulativeValue1``.

                        odosExecutionData
                    )
                )
            );
        }

        address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
        bytes32 hashedSigner = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(signer));
@Audit>        if (hashedSigner == hashedAdminTwo) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Introduce a state variable to track the nonce for each user;Increment the nonce after every verification to ensure signatures cannot be reused.
