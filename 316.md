# Missing lastEventTime update in liquidate()

### Summary

We miss the `lastEventTime` update in liquidate(). This will cause borrowers need to pay more borrow interest than expected.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing:liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L363), admin can liquidation unhealthy borrow positions.
In liquidate() function, we will calculate the cumulative rate between `lastEventTime` and `block.timestamp`. The problem is that we don't update `lastEventTime` to block.timestamp after we calculate the cumulative rate. 
This will cause that when we calculate the cumulative rate next time, we will use the previous `lastEventTime` and borrowers need to pay more borrow interest than expected.

For example:
1. Alice deposits tokens in timestamp A. After deposit, `lastEventTime` = timestamp A.
2. Admin liquidates Alice's borrow position in timestamp A + 100, we calculate the cumulative rate, the borrow interest between timestampA and timestamp A + 100 will be involved in `lastCumulativeRate`. But we don't update `lastEventTime`, so `lastEventTime` = timestamp A.
3. Bob deposit tokens in timestamp A + 200. When we calculate the cumulative rate, we will repeat calculating the cumulative rate between timestamp A and timestamp A + 100.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
               ...
        } else {
@>            uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
