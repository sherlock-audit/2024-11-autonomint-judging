# Potential Locking of Liquidation Interest Funds in `Treasury` Contract For Ever

### Summary

In the `Treasury` contract, the `totalInterestFromLiquidation` variable accumulates interest from liquidations but lacks a mechanism to be directly reduced or withdrawn, potentially locking these funds indefinitely within the contract.

### Root Cause

The `withdrawInterest()` function checks if the total interest (sum of `totalInterest` and `totalInterestFromLiquidation`) is sufficient for the withdrawal.
However, it only decrements `totalInterest`, not `totalInterestFromLiquidation`.

```solidity
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
@>      require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
@>      totalInterest -= amount;
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```

Without decrementing totalInterestFromLiquidation, these funds remain locked and inaccessible for withdrawal, even though they are accounted for in the total available interest.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Without a mechanism to decrement or utilize `totalInterestFromLiquidation`, these funds may remain inaccessible, effectively locking them within the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Implement logic within existing functions, such as `withdrawInterest()`, to decrement `totalInterestFromLiquidation` when interest is withdrawn.
2. Consider creating new functions or mechanisms to allow for the utilization of these funds in a controlled manner.
