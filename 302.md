Me:
> Since amount to swap depends strongly on exchange rate, and for non Eth swap, the odosAssembledData seem to already contain the swap amount which cannot be readjusted small changes in exchange rate will affect the swap amount, and this mismatch will result in failure as the approval given by the treasury may be insufficient for the withdrawal
I will like to know the information that is contained in the `odosAssembledData` to carefully analyze what the situation might be

Sponsor:
> There is a possibility for it.
The swap amount is calculated in our backend. Based on current prices and exchange rates.

The quote above is a conversation i had with the sponsors in a private thread.
The choice of using `ODOS` swap service may temporarily DOS withdrawals in unstable market conditions or cause permanent loss of funds. The snippet below will help explain the situation better 
```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        // Get the deposit details
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getDepositDetails(msg.sender, index);

        // call Caluculate ratio function to update tha changes in cds and eth vaults
        _calculateRatio(0, ethPrice);
    //Skip Implementation....
        if (amountToSwap > 0) {
            // found the exact amount of collateral
@>>         amountToSwap = (amountToSwap * 1 ether) / exchangeRate;
            // call the swapCollateralForUSDT in treasury
@>>         treasury.swapCollateralForUSDT(depositDetail.assetName, amountToSwap, odosAssembledData);
        }
    //Skip Implementation.......
```

The amount to swap per withdrawal depends strongly on the current exchange rate as seen in the highlighted line of the snippet above. Meanwhile according to the sponsor, the `odosAssembledData`  contains information on the swap amount which  is calculated in Autonomint backend, based on current prices and exchange rates.
Between the time of transaction initiation and execution, one cannot predict changes in prices. There are 2 possibilites here. 
1. **Increase in exchange rate**: Any increase in the exchange rate decreases the swap amount. The implication of this issue is that the treasury will approve the odos router an amount less than the off-chain calculated value, which will cause a revert due to an approval amount being less than actual swap amount.
[treasury.sol::swapCollateralForUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L804)
```solidity
823             bool approved = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(asset)).approve(odosRouterV2, swapAmount);
824             // check whether the approve is successful or not
825             if (!approved) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
826         }
827 
828         // pass the odos assembled data as msg.data to routerV2 contract of odos
829         // if the asset is native, pass as msg.value
830         (bool success, bytes memory result) = odosRouterV2.call{value: asset == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? swapAmount : 0}(odosAssembledData);
831 
832         // check the swap is successful or not.
833         if (!success) revert Treasury_SwapFailed();

```
In unstable market conditions, this will DOS withdrawal for extended period.

2. **Decrease In exchange rate**; Any decrease in exchange rate increases the on-chain calculated swap amount, and will result in a situation where the off-chain calculated swap amount will be less than the on-chain calculated swap amount. This can result in 2 highly dangerous situations
* From L830 in the snippet above, If the swap token is native , it sends the on-chain calculated swap amount along with the swap call, while the odos router swaps the off-chain calculated amount in the `odosAssembledata`. leading to permanent loss of funds. The accumulation of this excess amount being sent will gradually put the protocol in a state of insolvency.
* If the swap token is non native the contract will approve the odos router of an amount greater than the off-chain calculated amount, but there will be a swap of a lesser amount. The internal accounting in the contract is done using the on-chain calculated swap amount, while there might have been a swap of a lesser amount .
**Not completely sure how odos works**( A malicious observer off chain may be able to use what is left of the previous approval to swap tokens to their account using the odos router, hence resulting in permanent loss for the protocol.)

NOTE: In the case of increase in on-chain swap amount, the internal accounting of the protocol is affected causing mismanagement of user funds


### Impact

This issue poses a DOS and loss of funds in certain conditions, hence High seems right for the severity.
