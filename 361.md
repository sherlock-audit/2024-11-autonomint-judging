# `MasterPriceOracle` is not calculating correctly exchange rate for Optimism

### Summary

In the current implementation of `MasterPriceOracle`, the contract calculates in a wrong way the exchange rate which is return for tokens different than the ETH.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L88-L92

### Root Cause

If we dive deep in the implementation of `MasterPriceOracle` and more precisely in the function `_price`, in the case where the optimism chain is handled, if the asset is different than ETH, for example weETH, it will use as exchange rate between the `weETH` and `ETH` the price of the ETH in USD, which is not correct. 

```solidity
else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData(); // audited no staleness check
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The other(such as weETH) tokens, that are supported will have wrong a exchange rate, leading to wrong computations and users could end up having a worst exchange rate than it is expected, leading to wrong computing of `depositingAmount`. 

### PoC

Let's look at the following scenario:
1. ETH price is 3300$ and the current price of weETH is 3450$.
2. One user wants to deposit 1 weETH and this line `params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;` will calculate the `depositingAmount` will be equal to the current price of 1 eth in usd multiplied by the amount and divided by 1 ether. The problem is also that the `exchangeRate` is with 8 decimals.

### Mitigation

Use correct exchange rate.
