# `GlobalVariables` may be compromised, if there are concurrent in-flight messages

### Summary

Protocol uses omnichain approach to use shared variables between OP and Mode to store important state variables, which are used in calculating important system params.

### Root Cause

The problem is that if two transactions are initiated in the same time from the both chains (e.g borrowing::depostTokens), they will both initialize a lzSend message, which will update the dest omniChainData by overriding it, effectively erasing one of of the actions:
```solidity
        function _lzReceive(
            Origin calldata /*_origin*/,
            bytes32 /*_guid*/,
            bytes calldata payload,
            address /*_executor*/,
            bytes calldata /*_extraData*/
        ) internal override {
...
        // Update the global omnichain data struct
        omniChainData = oappData.message;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- Interacting with the protocol on the both chains in the same time

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Imagine two users deposit 1 eth on both chains in the same time:
- `totalNoOfDepositIndices` after finalizing the transaction should be 2, but instead it will be 1
- because inside `BorrowLib::deposit` we fetch `omniChainData` for the current chain and increment it by 1
- then send the updated `omniChainData` to the remote chain
- on the remote chain we override `omniChainData`, which will result in `totalNoOfDepositIndices = 1`, instead of incrementing it.

### Impact

Compromised state data, which results in messed up accounting and calculations.

### PoC

-

### Mitigation

Consider bridging the delta changes in as message, instead of raw [omniChainData that is overridden on dest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L630-L642). 
Example:
Message should contain `totalNoOfDepositIndices  = 1` (meaning we want to increase dest `totalNoOfDepositIndices` by 1)
