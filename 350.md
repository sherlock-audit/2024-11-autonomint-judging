# Incorrect State Updates in transferFrom Function

### Summary

In the transferFrom function, the contract incorrectly updates the userStates mapping, leading to inconsistencies between the user states and token balances.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L147C5-L170C5

The function updates userStates[msg.sender] instead of userStates[from] after debiting the fromState. This means that the state of the wrong user (msg.sender instead of from) is updated.
