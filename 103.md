# Protocol fees from gains cannot be withdrawn from treasury

### Summary
The protocol takes 10% of the gains of a dCDS depositor. Usually from the optionFees accrued. However, currently there isn't any mechanism that enables the admins to withdraw those funds from the treasury.

### Root Cause

In CDSLib.sol we use the `calculateUserProportionInWithdraw` to calculate the amount which we will return to the user, and deduct 10% for the protocol revenue.
```solidity
    function calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(uint256 depositedAmount, uint256 returnAmount)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint128)
    {
        uint256 toUser;
        // if the return amount is greater than depsoited amount,
        // deduct 10% from it
        if (returnAmount > depositedAmount) {
            uint256 profit = returnAmount - depositedAmount;
            toUser = returnAmount - (profit * 10) / 100;
        } else {
            toUser = returnAmount;
        }

        return uint128(toUser);
    }
```

In the withdrawUser function, we call it, and then update the collected usda amount in the treasury. - [CDSLib.sol#L800-L804](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L800-L804)
```solidity
                params.usdaToTransfer =
                    calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, returnAmountWithGains);
                //Update the treasury data
                interfaces.treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(returnAmountWithGains - params.usdaToTransfer);
```

However in Treasury.sol we just update it, and there is no way of actually withdrawing those USDa amounts:
```solidity
   function updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(uint256 amount) external onlyCoreContracts {
        usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw += amount;
    }
```
### Internal Preconditions
The dCDS deposit has accrued yield (for example, from option fees).

### External Preconditions
_No response_

### Attack Path
- A dCDS depositor withdraws their position.
- The protocol deducts 10% of the position and saves the collected amount as a value in the Treasury.
- However, there is no mechanism for protocol admins to withdraw the collected value.

### Impact
Protocol revenue from dCDS depositors cannot be withdrawn, resulting in a 100% loss of that revenue.

### Mitigation
Implement a function that allows admins to withdraw the collected fees.
