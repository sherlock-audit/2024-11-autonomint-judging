# MasterPriceOracle.sol  returns incorrect price during flash crashes

### Summary

Chainlink price feeds have in-built minimum & maximum prices they will return; if during a flash crash, bridge compromise, or depegging event, an asset’s value falls below the price feed’s minimum price, the oracle price feed will continue to report the (now incorrect) minimum price.

For example:  weETH/ETH [0xb4479d436DDa5c1A79bD88D282725615202406E3]

```solidity
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
```
