# Treasury contract’s  updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw is not updated/increased when the function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq is called, as a result some usda will be out of the accounting mechanism(out of usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw).

### Summary

 when the function withdrawUser(cdslib.sol) is called, updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(which is 10% of profit) is  updated/increased but updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw is  not updated/increased when the function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq is called. As a result, those 10% of profit(some usda) will be   out of the accounting mechanism(out of usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw) in the treasury contract and those usda will be stuck in the treasury contract. See the function  withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq where params.usdaToTransfer = calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, params.returnAmount); where profit = (params.returnAmount - params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount) and  params.usdaToTransfer = params.returnAmount - 10% of profit. So the user gets params.returnAmount - 10% of profit and 10% of profit should be updated/increased in usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw but this is not done in the  the function  withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq .


### Root Cause

Treasury contract’s  updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw is not updated/increased  when the function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq is called

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = 500 and  params.returnAmount = 510 when the function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq is called.

2. now  the function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq calls calculateUserProportionInWithdraw, see the function calculateUserProportionInWithdraw where  as params.returnAmount i.e 510 is greater than params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount i.e 500, so profit is 510-500 = 10, now 10% of profit (i.e 10) is 1 which is deducted from params.returnAmount i.e 510, now 510-1 =509 usda is sent to user and 1(which is 10% of profit) should be updated/increased in usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw of treasury contract.but 1(which is 10% of profit) is not  updated/increased in usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw when  function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq is called.

3. see the  function withdrawUser(cdslib.sol) where  UsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(which is 10% of profit) is  updated/increased but UsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw is  not updated/increased in the function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(cdslib.sol). 

4. as a result, those 10% of profit(1 usda) will be   out of the accounting mechanism(out of usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw) in the treasury contract and those usda will be stuck in the treasury contract.

### Impact

some usda will be   out of the accounting mechanism(out of usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw) in the treasury contract and those usda will be stuck in the treasury contract. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update/increase  10% of profit in usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw  when  function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq is called i.e calls   interfaces.treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(returnAmountWithGains - params.usdaToTransfer) in function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq.
