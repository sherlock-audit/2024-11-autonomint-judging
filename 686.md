# Malicious user can front-run multiSign owner and grief admins

### Summary

In the `multiSign.sol` contract, there is a [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304) that is responsible for checking if there is enough approval count and consumes it (makes it `== false`, so the next call will revert) anytime it is being called. 

Due to the lack of modifiers in `multiSign.sol::executeSetterFunction()` anyone can front-run admins and call this function before them, making the admins' call `revert`.

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Set the function, If reqired approvals from the owners met
 * @param _function Fucntion to execute setter
 */
function executeSetterFunction(
    SetterFunctions _function
) external returns (bool) {
    // Get the number of approvals
    require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
    // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

Example:
requiredApprovals = 5;
currentApprovals = 4;
Bob sees that last approval and knows that after the block is finalized he will be able to pay higher gas fees and front-run the admins and consume the `approvedToUpdate` array.
