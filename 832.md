# Cross-Contract Reentrancy Vulnerability in CDS Withdraw Function

### Summary

The withdraw function in the CDS contract is vulnerable to cross-contract reentrancy attacks due to delayed updates to the omniChainData global state. During execution, funds are transferred to the user via a low-level `.call `function, granting control to the user before `omniChainData` is updated. A malicious user could exploit this by calling borrowing contract and altering the global omniChainData state. This results in the outdated in-memory omniChainData being used to overwrite the updated global state at the end of the transaction, breaking calculations and potentially preventing user withdrawals from borrowing contract.

### Root Cause

In the CDS withdraw function, the omniChainData is fetched and stored in memory at the beginning of the transaction. This data is subsequently updated in the global state only after all operations are complete. During the execution of the withdraw function, if the user opts for liquidation gains, the function transfers ETH to the user using the .call function. This grants control to the user mid-execution.

A malicious user can exploit this control to interact with borrowing contract, modifying the global omniChainData state. However, at the end of the withdraw function, the outdated in-memory omniChainData is written back to the global state, overwriting any legitimate changes made during the reentrant call.

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint64 index,
    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory signature
) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
    // Step 1: Fetch omniChainData in memory
    IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory omniChainData = globalVariables.getOmniChainData();
    // Perform calculations and updates using in-memory omniChainData
   withdrawResult = CDSLib.withdrawUser(
              WithdrawUserParams(cdsDepositDetails,
                omniChainData, ...));

    // Step 4: Update global state, overwriting changes made during reentrancy
     globalVariables.setOmniChainData(withdrawResult.omniChainData); // @audit outdated data overwrites updates
}

 function withdrawUser(
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
        if (!params.cdsDepositDetails.optedLiquidation) {
        } else {
                

               //  Step 2: Transfer liquidation gains to user from treasury
                if (params.ethAmount != 0) {
                    params.omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators -= totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH;
                    // Call transferEthToCdsLiquidators to tranfer eth
                    interfaces.treasury.transferEthToCdsLiquidators(
                        msg.sender,
                        params.ethAmount
                    );
                }

}
}

    function transferEthToCdsLiquidators(
        address user,
        uint128 amount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
  
        //  Step 3: Transfer ETH, control transferred to user
        (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: amount}("");
        if (!sent) revert Treasury_EthTransferToCdsLiquidatorFailed();
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Malious user deposit to CDS contract with an custom contract that implements  fallback function
2. Liquidation gains should include ETH amount 
3. Malious user should be able to claim ETH when withdrawing from CDS

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User Calls CDS withdraw
- omniChainData is fetched and stored in memory.
2. Malicious User Gains Control via .call:
- During the execution of withdraw, if the user has opted for liquidation gains, the function attempts to transfer ETH to the user via .call.
3. Malicious User Modifies omniChainData via Borrowing Contract
- While holding control, the malicious user interacts with the borrowing contract and deposits a large amount (X) to manipulate the global omniChainData.
- This action updates the global omniChainData, specifically increasing totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei.
5. Outdated omniChainData Overwrites Updates:
-  After the control is returned to the withdraw function, it proceeds to write back the outdated in-memory omniChainData to the global state.
- Changes made to omnichainData in the borrowing contract are overwritten, causing incorrect state updates.
6. Malicious User Withdraws from Borrowing Contract
- After the withdraw function completes, the malicious user interacts with the borrowing contract again and withdraws the previously deposited amount (X).
- This action reduces totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei in the global omniChainData to a value lower than it should be, due to the overwritten state.
8. If the malicious user repeats this attack multiple times with high X values `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` becomes artificially low preventing users withdrawal from borrowing the contract









### Impact

Incorrect omniChainData values disrupt critical calculations, such as the CDS pool-to-ETH ratio, cumulative values
Withdrawal operations in borrowing contract may fail due to invalid state variables.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adhere to the checks-effects-interactions pattern. 
Update the global state (omniChainData) before transferring control to the user.
