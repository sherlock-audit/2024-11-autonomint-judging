# Stale `lastCumulativeRate` Used in Borrower Deposit and Borrower Withdrawal Calculations

### Summary

The `lastCumulativeRate` variable, which should reflect the most recent cumulative rate at the time of deposit or withdrawal, is being updated after calculations for normalized amounts and borrower debt. This results in the use of a stale cumulative rate for calculations, leading to inaccuracies in protocol operations.

### Root Cause

The `lastCumulativeRate` is calculated and updated after the protocol computes:

1. Normalized Amount during deposit.
2. Borrower Debt during withdrawal.

Since `lastCumulativeRate` is time-sensitive and changes every second, this delay causes the protocol to use an outdated rate for calculations, rather than the rate corresponding to the current block timestamp when the action is initiated.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower initiates a withdrawal or deposit at block.timestamp = 5000.

2. The protocol calculates normalized amounts or borrower debt using a stale lastCumulativeRate from a prior action, e.g., block.timestamp = 4900.

3. **Impact**:

- During withdrawal, the borrowerâ€™s debt is calculated using an outdated cumulative rate, resulting in a lower debt amount.
- The protocol incurs a loss as the debt repayment is less than the actual liability.
- During deposit, normalized amounts may inaccurately reflect the depositor's share of the pool.

### Impact

1. **Financial Inaccuracy**: Borrowers underpay their debt due to lower cumulative rates being used, causing a loss to the protocol.

2. **Fairness Issues**: Depositors and borrowers are treated inconsistently as calculations are not based on the most up-to-date protocol state.

### Mitigation

Update lastCumulativeRate Before calling: 
1. BorrowLib.deposit in borrowing deposit
2. BorrowLib.withdraw in  borrowing withdraw
