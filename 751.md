# Lack of Access Control in `CDS.updateDownsideProtected()` Function

### Summary

The `updateDownsideProtected()` function in the `CDS` contract does not have any access control modifiers. This means that anybody can call this function and modify the `downsideProtected` state variable. This lack of restriction could potentially lead to unauthorized manipulation of the downside protection mechanism.

### Root Cause

The `updateDownsideProtected()` function is declared as external without any modifiers. This allow malicious actors or unintended users can alter the downsideProtected value.

```solidity
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the [`updateDownsideProtected()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829) function, setting `downsideProtected` to a value equal to  `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.
2. The attacker makes a minimal deposit (e.g., 1 wei of USDT) using the [`deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L186) function. This triggers the [`_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L833) function.
3. The `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` function reduces `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` by the `downsideProtected` amount.
Since `downsideProtected` was set to `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, this operation can reduce both `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` to zero or dust values.

### Impact

1. The contract's accounting for deposited amounts is disrupted, potentially leading to incorrect calculations for withdrawals and other financial operations.
2. By manipulating `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, the attacker can exploit financial calculations to their advantage. This manipulation could allow them to extract more value than they are entitled to or cause financial losses to other users.
3. Since the withdrawal functions heavily depend on `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, other users may be unable to withdraw their funds or interact with the contract as expected due to the manipulated state variables, effectively locking their assets.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Restrict the `updateDownsideProtected()` function to only be callable by trusted entities, such as the contract owner or an authorized admin, using modifiers like `onlyOwner` or `onlyAdmin`.
