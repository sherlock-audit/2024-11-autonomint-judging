# Missing Slippage Protection in CDS Liquidation Share Calculation

## Summary
The CDS contract's liquidation participation mechanism exposes a critical vulnerability through unprotected liquidation amount specification. When users opt into liquidation during deposit, they can specify exact liquidationAmount values without any market-based constraints or slippage protection.

The deposit function accepts a direct liquidationAmount parameter that gets added to totalAvailableLiquidationAmount without evaluating market conditions, price impact, or existing depositor shares. This architectural design enables MEV extraction through precise frontrunning of liquidation events.

Malicious actors can monitor pending liquidations and strategically time deposits with calculated liquidationAmount values to capture maximum value from the liquidation proceeds. The lack of economic friction in this process means attackers can optimize their deposit timing and amounts to extract value from legitimate CDS depositors who entered positions earlier.

The severity stems from both the systematic extraction of value from protocol participants and the undermining of the liquidation mechanism's economic security model.

## Proof of Concept
Initial Setup:
- Large CDP exists with 1000 ETH collateral
- Current available liquidation pool has 10 depositors with 100,000 USDT each
- ETH price is trending down towards liquidation threshold

Attack Path:
1. Attacker monitors mempool/price feeds and detects CDP will be liquidatable soon
   - Calculates optimal moment right before liquidation trigger
   - Prepares large USDT position 

2. Just before liquidation price hits:
   - Attacker deposits 500,000 USDT
   - Sets liquidationAmount = 500,000 (50% of total pool)
   - Position is immediately eligible for liquidation participation

3. When liquidation executes:
   - 1000 ETH collateral gets liquidated
   - Attacker's position (joined seconds ago) gets 50% of ETH
   - Original 10 depositors split remaining 50%
   - Each original depositor gets only 5% despite equal capital

4. Attacker exits:
   - Sells acquired ETH immediately
   - Withdraws USDT deposit after minimum period
   - Profits from liquidation without taking long-term protocol risk

Result:
- Original depositors: severely diluted returns
- Attacker: maximum extraction with minimal risk
- Protocol: undermined liquidation incentives
- Future: reduced willingness to provide long-term liquidation coverage

This can be repeated across multiple liquidation events, consistently extracting value from legitimate participants.

Vulnerable code in CDS.sol:

```solidity
function deposit(...) {
    if(liquidate) {
        totalAvailableLiquidationAmount += liquidationAmount;
    }
}
```

## Recommended mitigation steps
The core mitigation requires implementing market-aware liquidation participation through a combination of slippage protection and share-based allocation:

```solidity
function deposit(
    uint128 usdtAmount,
    uint128 usdaAmount,
    bool liquidate,
    uint128 liquidationAmount,
    uint128 minLiquidationShare,
    uint128 lockingPeriod
) external {
    if(liquidate) {
        uint256 actualShare = (liquidationAmount * PRECISION) / totalAvailableLiquidationAmount;
        require(actualShare >= minLiquidationShare, "Excessive slippage");
        require(liquidationAmount <= totalAvailableLiquidationAmount * MAX_SHARE, "Share too high");
        
        liquidationEnableTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + MIN_LIQUIDATION_DELAY;
    }
    // Continue with deposit logic
}
```

This pattern implements proper economic friction through share-based limitations and time delays. The system should also track historical liquidation data to establish dynamic bounds for participation rates and implement proper rebalancing mechanisms to maintain fair value distribution among all depositors.
