# Swap Amount Mismatch in ODOS Service: Potential for DOS

### Summary

The withdrawal process in the ``Autonomint`` protocol is vulnerable to potential Denial of Service (DOS) due to a mismatch between the calculated swap amount and the amount approved in the backend for swap transactions. This issue arises because the ODOS swap service relies on exchange rates to determine the amount to be swapped, which can fluctuate between the transaction initiation and execution, leading to mismatches between off-chain and on-chain swap amounts.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the unforeseen changes of exchange rates. The ``Autonomint`` protocol approves an amount for swap from their backend for each user withdrawal, but the amount swapped is determined by real-time on-chain conditions. These fluctuations in the exchange rate can cause discrepancies between the backend calculated swap amount and the real time calculated amount, leading to failures or loss of funds.

The ``odosAssembledData`` parameter is obtained by using current exchange rates at the time of querying the odos api, while the on-chain calculation in the contract uses the current exchange rate at the time of execution. The swap amount is adjusted based on the exchange rate as shown below:
```solidity
amountToSwap = (amountToSwap * 1 ether) / exchangeRate;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions
Increase/Decrease in exchange rate



### Attack Path
1. User interact with autonomint backend at timestamp `100` and swap amount is evaluated as 100
2. User calls withdraw at timestamp `101` 
3. There is an increase in exchange rate at timestamp `101`
4. Transaction is added to a block at timestamp `105`, and swap amount is readjusted to 99
5. The external call to odos router will revert since the router will attempt to do a `transferfrom` of 100, while the contract currently approves the router of 99




### Impact

- **Denial of Service (DOS)**: Withdrawals may fail due to insufficient approval when the exchange rate increases, causing transaction reverts..
