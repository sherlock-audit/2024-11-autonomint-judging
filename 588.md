# weETH and rsETH yields are calculated incorrectly, causing withdrawals to fail

### Summary

When users withdraw from CDS they may receive weETH and rsETH from vault liquidations. Currently, yields that have accrued from the point of liquidation to the time of withdrawal are deducted from the weETH and rsETH that the user should receive. The issue is that the yields are calculated incorrectly and will likely cause the withdrawals to revert.

### Root Cause

In CDSLib.withdraw this is how the yields are calculated:

```solidity
                    weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.weETH_ExchangeRate) + 
                    rsETHAmount - ((rsETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.rsETH_ExchangeRate)
```

This is incorrect and highly dangerous as if the exchange rate has gone down, an underflow will occur, where the amount deducted from weETHAmount or rsETHAmount will be higher than weETHAmount/rsETHAmount, causing the withdrawal to fail.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Between the time that a vault liquidation had occured and a CDS deposit had been withdrawn the price of weETH has gone down.
2. This will cause the weETH/ETH exchange rate to also decrease.
3. As a result, `((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.weETH_ExchangeRate)` will be higher than `weETHAmount` leading to a revert.

### Impact

Withdrawals will revert if the weETH and rsETH exhange rates have decreased.

### Mitigation

Only accumulate yields if the exchange rates have gone up.
