# Missing Access Control on updateDownsideProtected() Enables Critical Pool Manipulation in CDS Protocol

### Summary

Lack of access control on updateDownsideProtected() will cause severe protocol disruption for CDS users and borrowers as malicious actors can artificially inflate downsideProtected value which gets subtracted from critical pool amounts, potentially blocking deposits, withdrawals and liquidations.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829   the updateDownsideProtected() function lacks access control:
```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls updateDownsideProtected() with a large value close to or exceeding totalCdsDepositedAmount
2. When next deposit/withdraw occurs, _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() is called
3. Inside _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount(), inflated downsideProtected is subtracted from totalCdsDepositedAmount and totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
4. These reduced pool amounts affect critical ratio calculations
5. If ratio drops below 2x RATIO_PRECISION, protocol operations revert

### Impact

The protocol suffers severe functionality disruption:
- Protocol operations like deposits and withdrawals can be blocked when pool ratio drops below required threshold
- Liquidations may fail due to artificially reduced available amounts
- Economic calculations for fees and interest distributions are disrupted
- All CDS users are affected as pool amounts are manipulated
- The attacker can effectively DOS the protocol
