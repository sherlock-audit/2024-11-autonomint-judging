# Wrong applying of `lastCumulativeRate` can lead to increasing of borrower's debt or decreasing borrower's repay amount, unexpectedly.

### Summary

Applying `lastCumulativeRate` before update it will cause wrong calculation of borrower's `normalizedAmount` leading to increasing of borrower's debt or decreasing of borrower's repay amount, unexpectedly.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L257

### Root Cause

- In `borrowing.sol#depositTokens()` function, `lastCumulativeRate` is applied before updating it.
```solidity
    function depositTokens(
        BorrowDepositParams memory depositParam
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(0)) {
        // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);
        // calculting fee
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositParam.assetName,
            _options,
            false
        );
        // Get the exchange rate for a collateral and eth price
        (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[depositParam.assetName]);

        totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
            BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
                LTV,
                APR,
@>              lastCumulativeRate,
                totalNormalizedAmount,
                exchangeRate,
                ethPrice,
                lastEthprice
            ),
            depositParam,
            Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options),
            assetAddress
        );

        //Call calculateCumulativeRate() to get currentCumulativeRate
@>      calculateCumulativeRate();
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);

        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositParam.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
```

- In BorrowLib.sol:750, lastCumulativeRate is applied to calculate `normalizedAmount`.
```solidity
    // Calculate normalizedAmount
    uint256 normalizedAmount = calculateNormAmount(tokensToMint, libParams.lastCumulativeRate);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- When depositing, borrower gets more `normalizedAmount` than normal - this means he gets more debt.
- When withdrawing, borrower repays less amount than normal - this means protocol's loss because of zero-sum.


### PoC

1. In case of depositing in borrowing.sol.
- We say that lastCumulativeRate is 2e27. After time passes, `currentCumulativeRate` becomes `2.1e27` but lastCumulativeRate is not updated yet.
- A user deposits some `eth`, so `tokensToMint` which he borrows is 100e6. Then, his `normalizedAmount` becomes `100e6 * 1e27 / 2e27 = 50e6`.
- After deposit, `lastCumulativeRate` is updated instantly - 2.1e27. This means borrower's debt becomes `50e6 * 2.1e27 / 1e27 = 105e6`.
- This is borrower's instant loss.

2. In case of withdrawing in borrowing.sol
As same way as depositing, the user repays less amount than normal.


### Mitigation

1. `borrowing.sol#depositTokens()` function has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function depositTokens(
        BorrowDepositParams memory depositParam
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(0)) {
        // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);
        // calculting fee
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositParam.assetName,
            _options,
            false
        );
        // Get the exchange rate for a collateral and eth price
        (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[depositParam.assetName]);

++      calculateCumulativeRate();
        totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
            BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
                LTV,
                APR,
                lastCumulativeRate,
                totalNormalizedAmount,
                exchangeRate,
                ethPrice,
                lastEthprice
            ),
            depositParam,
            Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options),
            assetAddress
        );

        //Call calculateCumulativeRate() to get currentCumulativeRate
--      calculateCumulativeRate();
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);

        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositParam.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
```
