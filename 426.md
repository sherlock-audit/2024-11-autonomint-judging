# _lzReceived in dstChain will be reverted

### Summary

_lzReceived in dstChain will be reverted

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L407

### PoC

**Textual PoC:**

1-user deposit 1 ETH as collateral when eth price $1000 and he/she get 800 usda as borrow amount

2-let's assume eth price drop to $799 and user become eligible for liquidation

3-and lets assume borrowDebt is 900 usda its mean user should return 900 usda to treasury and 10 usda as returnAbondAmount its mean liquidationAmountNeeded is 910 usda

4-and let's assume there is 2000 usda in other chains and 2000 usda in this chain as cds depositedAmount

5-and let's assume there is 460 usda as availableLiqAmount in other chain and availableLiqAmount in this chain is 410usda

6-liqAmountToGet is 455 usda because share is 0.5 and liqAmountRemaining is 455 usda

7-liqAmountToGet[455] is less than totalAvailableLiqAmountInOtherChain[460] and liqAmountRemaining[455] is greater than _totalAvailableLiqAmount[410]

8- diff between liqAmountRemaining and _totalAvailableLiqAmount is [455 - 410 = 45] usda will be added to liqAmountToGet[455 + 45 = 500] usda

as we can see 500 usda is greater than totalAvailableLiqAmountInOtherChain[460]


### Impact

when dstChain received messages `GlobalVariables::_lzReceived` will be called which in turn calls `CDS::updateTotalAvailableLiquidationAmount` but transaction will be reverted because of underflow

### Mitigation

Consdier to compare liqAmountToGet with totalAvailableLiqAmountInOtherChain
