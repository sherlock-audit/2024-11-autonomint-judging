# Adversary can grief users by transfering abond to reduce the user's ethBacked, thus reducing their redeemable yield

### Summary

The ABond transfer mechanism's weighted average calculation for ethBacked values in `Colors._calculateEthBacked()` can be exploited by malicious actors to grief legitimate users by sending small amounts of ABonds from wallets with low ethBacked values, which forces a reduction in the victim's ethBacked ratio and consequently reduces their yield earnings.

### Root Cause

When ABonds are transferred in [`Abond_Token.sol:114`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L114-L139), the recipient's new ethBacked value is calculated using a weighted average formula that considers both the sender's and receiver's current states.

In Colors.sol:

```solidity
currentEthBacked = ((_balanceA * _ethBackedA)+(_balanceB * _ethBackedB))/(_balanceA + _balanceB)
```

An aversary can exploit this by:

1. Creating a wallet with minimal ETH backing (low ethBacked)
2. Transferring small amounts of ABonds to target wallets with high ethBacked values
3. The weighted average calculation will force a reduction in the victim's ethBacked value

### Attack Path

Initial State:
Victim: 3000 ABonds, ethBacked = 5 ETH
Attacker: 100 ABonds, ethBacked = 0.1 ETH

Attack:
Attacker transfers 7.5 ABonds to Victim roughly ($30)

New ethBacked calculation for Victim:
= ((5 * 0.1) + (3000 * 5)) / (5 + 3000)
= 4.98 ETH

Result:
Victim's ethBacked reduced from 5 ETH to 4.98 ETH which will reduce yield earning

### Impact

When a victim with high ethBacked (e.g., 5 ETH) receives even a small transfer from an attacker with low ethBacked (e.g., 0.1 ETH), their ethBacked value will be permanently reduced due to the weighted average calculation.

### Mitigation

1. Implement transfer blacklisting/whitelisting to allow users to protect their positions
2. Add minimum transfer amounts based on ethBacked ratios
