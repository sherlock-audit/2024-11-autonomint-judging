# `borrowing::liquidate()` sends the wrong liquidation index to the destination chain, overwritting liquidation information and getting collateral stuck

### Summary

`borrowing::liquidate()` sends the `noOfLiquidations` variable as liquidation index to the other chain. However, liquidations are tracked in `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations`, on both chains. For example, if a liquidation happens on chain A, it increases to 1 and sends this information to chain B. If a liquidation happens on chain B, it will have index 2, not 1. 

### Root Cause

In `borrowing:402`, the wrong variable is sent as liquidation index to the other chain.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidation happens on chain A, incrementing `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` to 1 and `noOfLiquidations` to 1 also.
2. Liquidation happens on chain B, [with index 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L199) (it received the omnichain data from chain A and then incremented it). In chain B, it sends the liquidation info to chain A, but sends with index 1, not 2, as it uses the local  `noOfLiquidations` to send the index.
3. Chain A will have liquidation info with index 1 overiwritten by the liquidation of chain B, leading to stuck collateral of the first liquidation in chain A (as long as depositors have not withdraw, but if they have, they can't withdraw the second liquidation anyway).

### Impact

Stuck collateral.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Pass in the correct index, given by `omnichainData.noOfLiquidations`.
