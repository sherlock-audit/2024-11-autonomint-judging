# Price Scaling Overflow in Synthetix Position Closure

## Summary
The closeThePositionInSynthetix function performs price scaling without checking for overflow, which could lead to incorrect order prices and failed transactions.

## Vulnerability Detials:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L374
```solidity
function closeThePositionInSynthetix() external onlyBorrowingContract {
    (, uint128 ethPrice) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH));
    synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
        -synthetixPerpsV2.positions(address(this)).size, 
        ethPrice * 1e16  // Vulnerable line
    );
}
```
The vulnerability arises when the ETH price (stored as uint128) is multiplied by 1e16 for scaling, which can cause an arithmetic overflow since the result could exceed the maximum value of uint256, leading to failed transactions and the inability to close positions, particularly during periods of high ETH prices.

## PoC:
Initial Setup
ETH Price: $300,000 (3e5)
Price with 18 decimals: 3e23
ethPrice stored as uint128: 3e23

Market Conditions
- ETH price spikes to near max uint128
- Oracle reports valid but very high price
- Price = 3.4e38 (near max uint128)

Position Closure Attempt
Step 1: Get price from oracle
- ethPrice = 3.4e38 (uint128 max)

Step 2: Scale price
- calculation: 3.4e38 * 1e16
- Result: Overflow, transaction reverts

Impact
- Position cannot be closed
- System becomes locked
- Must wait for price to decrease
- Potential losses during waiting period

## Impact

System becomes unusable during high prices
Positions cannot be closed when needed most
Potential financial losses
System reliability compromised

## Recommendation:
Add overflow checks before scaling
