# `Abond_Token` contract will incorrectly update sender state during `transferFrom` leading to broken accounting and loss of funds

### Summary

The `transferFrom` function in the `Abond_Token` contract incorrectly updates the sender's state, potentially leading to broken accounting and an inconsistent token balance.

### Root Cause

In `Abond_Token.sol:165`, the `transferFrom` function updates the state of `msg.sender` instead of the `from` address. This results in the actual sender's (`from`) state remaining unchanged, while the `msg.sender`'s state being incorrectly modified.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user (`msg.sender`) initiates a `transferFrom` transaction to transfer tokens from address `from` to address `to`.
2. The `transferFrom` function executes, but instead of updating the state of the `from` address, it incorrectly updates the state of the `msg.sender`.
3. This leads to an inconsistency where the `from` address still appears to hold the tokens, even though they have been transferred to the `to` address.

### Impact

- **Incorrect accounting:** The incorrect state update can lead to discrepancies in the token balances and accounting records, making it difficult to track the actual ownership and distribution of tokens.
- Potential unexpected revert in `transferFrom` if `msg.sender` doesn't have enough tokens.
- Loss of funds for `msg.sender` as his balance is used instead of the one of `from` address.

### PoC

The issue lies in this line of code below [Abond_Token::L147-L170](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L147-L170):

```solidity
  function transferFrom(
      address from,
      address to,
      uint256 value
  ) public override returns (bool) {
      // check the input params are non zero
      require(from != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User");

      // get the sender and receiver state
      State memory fromState = userStates[from];
      State memory toState = userStates[to];

      // update receiver state
      toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value));
      userStates[to] = toState;

      // update sender state
      fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
      //@audit should update from address
      userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;

      // transfer abond
      super.transferFrom(from, to, value);
      return true;
  }
```

The function updates the state of the `msg.sender` instead of the actual sender (`from`).

To demonstrate the impact, consider the following scenario:

1. User A approves User B to spend 100 tokens.
2. User B initiates a `transferFrom` transaction to transfer 50 tokens from User A to User C.
3. Due to the incorrect state update, User A's balance will remain unchanged, while User B's balance will be incorrectly reduced by 50 tokens.

### Mitigation

In `Abond_Token.sol:165`, correct the state update to modify the `from` address's state instead of the `msg.sender`. Change `userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;` to `userStates[from] = fromState;` .
