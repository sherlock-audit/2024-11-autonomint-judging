# overflow/underflow error in exchange rate calculation will halt multiple user actions for an indefinite amount of time

### Summary

A faulty exchange rate calculation in `Treasury::_calculateCumulativeRate` and `Treasury::getCurrentCumulativeRate` will result in an overflow/underflow error whenever the current exchange rate is less than the previous one, hence will halt multiple user actions for an indefinite time, as there’s no guarantee that the current exchange rate will ever go above the previous one in the near future.

### Root Cause

In calculating the cumulative rate, `Treasury::_calculateCumulativeRate` and `Treasury::getCurrentCumulativeRate` functions have the following line (CUMULATIVE_PRECISION being 1e27)  ⇒

```solidity
           uint256 change = ((_currentExchangeRate - protocolDeposit[_protocol].exchangeRate) * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION)
                / protocolDeposit[_protocol].exchangeRate;
```

Here, in order to determine the change between the previous and current exchange rates from the external protocol, it subtracts the previously saved exchange rate from the current one.

Know that, for instance, in `treasury::depositToIonicByUser` it retrieves and saves the current exchange rate from ionic as the protocol exchangeRate.

What it does not take into account is, if the current exchange rate is lesser than the previous one, this calculation will revert with overflow/underflow error. 

Now, I’ll  talk about why this is a serious issue by showing what flows are affected by this shortcoming. But first, let’s look at a quick chisel proof to see that this calculation will indeed fail when the current rate is less than the previous one. On your terminal, run chisel and paste the contents here ⇒

```solidity
➜ uint256 _currentExchangeRate = 10;
➜ uint256 oldRate= 20;
➜  uint256  CUMULATIVE_PRECISION = 1e27
➜ uint256 change = ((_currentExchangeRate - oldRate) * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION )/ oldRate;

    └─ ← [Revert] panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11)

### So what?

Okay, cumulative rate calculation fails. But what are the implications of it? 

⇒ Case 1: Deposit

First things first: The user cannot deposit. Here’s the deposit call flow that halts in the above calculation error. If the user wants to deposit ETH:

borrowing::depositTokens ⇒ borrowLib::deposit⇒ treasury::deposit⇒ treasury::depositToIonicByUser⇒ _calculateCumulativeRate and BAM! If the current exchange rate of ionic is less than the previous recorded one, transaction reverts. For how long? We don’t know. Literally until the exchange rate surpasses the previous one.

That’s it? No.

⇒ Case 2: Liquidation

User needs to be liquidated. Admin starts the liquidation execution for the liquidation type 1:

borrowing::liquidate⇒borrowLiquidation::liquidateBorrowPosition⇒borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1⇒treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocolDuringLiq⇒treasury::withdrawFromIonicDuringLiq⇒treasury::_calculateCumulativeRate BAM! user cannot be liquidated, the protocol goes into bad debt and so on. For how long? No one knows.

⇒ Case 3: Redeem yields

User wants to redeem their yields:

borrowing::redeemYields⇒BorrowLib::redeemYields⇒ treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol⇒treasury::withdrawFromIonicByUser⇒ treasury::_calculateCumulativeRate BAM! User can’t redeem yields until the current exchange rate goes over the previous recorded one.

=> Case 4: Yield calculation (regarding getCurrentCumulativeRate)
borrowing::getAbondYields=>BorrowLib::getAbondYields=>  treasury::calculateYieldsForExternalProtocol =>treasury::getCurrentCumulativeRate BAM! Cannot calculate yields.

Note that if it's the first deposit, all is okay due to this if/else condition. It is only okay, because in the first deposit we're not dealing with rate changes. The moment we start dealing with the rate changes, the protocol is unprotected. Also, in the case of first deposit we wouldn't be talking about liquidation or yield generation.

```solidity
      uint256 currentCumulativeRate;
        // If it's the first deposit, set the cumulative rate to precision (i.e., 1 in fixed-point representation).
        if (protocolDeposit[_protocol].totalCreditedTokens == 0) {
            currentCumulativeRate = CUMULATIVE_PRECISION;
        } else {
            // Calculate the change in the credited amount relative to the total credited tokens so far.
            //@audit this calculation will either underflow or fail directly
            uint256 change = ((_currentExchangeRate - protocolDeposit[_protocol].exchangeRate) * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION)
                / protocolDeposit[_protocol].exchangeRate;
            // Update the cumulative rate using the calculated change.
            currentCumulativeRate =
                ((CUMULATIVE_PRECISION + change) * protocolDeposit[_protocol].cumulativeRate) / CUMULATIVE_PRECISION;
        }
```
So on the subsequent deposits, the problem is there and will halt the execution flow of the protocol for an indefinite amount of time.

### Impact

Cardinal protocol functions are halted for an indefinite amount of time. The user cannot deposit to the protocol, calculate or redeem yields, the admin cannot liquidate the user that should be liquidated. The only solution is to hope that the current exchange rate goes above the previous one soon.

First of all, keep in mind that rate fluctuations are paramount, and as we see from the chisel test above, even the slightest change will end up with a revert. 

The exchange rate will change constantly, and it is quite probable that  it goes under the one that's previously saved in the code, and stays under for a long time., leaving the protocol's important functions unusable during that time.

### PoC

For those who want to see foundry tests, here it is: Run `forge test --match-test test_func_calculateCumulativeRate  --fork-url wss://optimism-rpc.publicnode.com -vvvv`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

import {Test, StdUtils, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract MyTest is Test {
    function setUp() public {}

    function test_func_calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 CUMULATIVE_PRECISION = 1e27;
        uint256 _currentExchangeRate = 199;
        uint256 _previousExchangeRate = 200;

        uint256 change = ((_currentExchangeRate - _previousExchangeRate) * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / _previousExchangeRate;
        return change;
    }
}

```

Output:

```solidity
