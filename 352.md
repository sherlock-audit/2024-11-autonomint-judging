# when the  function liquidationType1 is called,treasury’s abondUSDaPool is increased/updated but  treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation should be increased/updated.

### Summary

 when the  function liquidationType1 is called,treasury’s abondUSDaPool is increased/updated but  treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation should be increased/updated.


### Root Cause

when the  function liquidationType1 is called,treasury’s abondUSDaPool is increased/updated but  treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation should be increased/updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. When the  function liquidationType1 is called, some amounts are added/updated to treasury’s abondUSDaPool i.e treasury.updateAbondUSDaPool(returnToAbond, true); but treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation is not increased/updated in the  function liquidationType1.

2. as treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation is not increased/updated anywhere in the contract, so treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation will be always 0.

3. now the function redeemYields(borrowlib.sol) is called where usdaToAbondRatioLiq will be always 0 because treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation is 0, so usdaToTransfer(for usdaGainedFromLiquidation) = 0.

4. so when the  function liquidationType1 is called,  treasury’s usdaGainedFromLiquidation  should be increased/updated which is intentend behaviour.
