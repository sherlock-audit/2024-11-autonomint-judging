# Incorrect require Logic for withdrawed Flag in withdraw Function

### Summary

The `withdraw` function in the `Treasury.sol` contains a critical logical flaw in the validation of the `withdrawed` flag within the DepositDetails struct. The current implementation allows withdrawals to proceed only if the depositDetails has already been marked as withdrawn due to the incorrect use of the require statement. This logic contradicts the intended behavior of the withdraw function.

### Root Cause

The require statement in the withdraw function is incorrectly implemented as it checks that `withdrawed` flag in the DepositDetails struct is true to allow withdrawals to proceed.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Deposits that are still valid and have not been withdrawn will be blocked, preventing legitimate access to collateral.
- Withdrawals are incorrectly allowed for deposits that have already been withdrawn.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the require statement to the below and set the depositDetails.withdrawed to true
``` solidity
       /**
     * @dev withdraw the deposited collateral
     * @param borrower borrower address
     * @param toAddress adrress to return collateral
     * @param amount amount of collateral to return
     * @param exchangeRate current exchanga rate of the deposited collateral
     * @param index deposit index
