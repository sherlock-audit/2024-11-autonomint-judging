# No storage gaps for contracts with complex storage structure.

### Summary
Upgradeable contracts don't have storage gaps defined, however they have complex structure.

### Root Cause
No storage gaps at the end of ABONDToken, borrowing.sol, CDS.sol, GlobalVariables, Treasury and & etc.

Example of all of them being upgradeable:
```solidity
contract Treasury is ITreasury, Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable {
```
```solidity
contract ABONDToken is
    Initializable,
    ERC20Upgradeable,
    ERC20BurnableUpgradeable,
    ERC20PausableUpgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
```
```solidity
contract GlobalVariables is
    IGlobalVariables,
    Initializable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OAppUpgradeable
{
```

```solidity
contract Borrowing is
    IBorrowing,
    Initializable,
    EIP712Upgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
```

### Impact
Potential problems like storage collisions, when trying to upgrade a contract.

### Mitigation
Add storage gaps for upgradeable contracts.
