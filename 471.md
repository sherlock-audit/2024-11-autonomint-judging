# Malicious users will steal funds by using other user's signatures when withdrawing from CDS

### Summary

Missing msg.sender validation in signature verification will cause a theft of funds for the CDS protocol as malicious users will reuse other user's signatures with lower excessProfitCumulativeValue to withdraw more funds than entitled.

### Root Cause

In [`CDS.sol:L285`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L285) there is a missing msg.sender validation in the `_verify()` function call parameters and verification logic.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A legitimate user needs to have signed a withdrawal with a low excessProfitCumulativeValue
2. The signed withdrawal transaction needs to be publicly visible/captured
3. The CDS contract needs to have sufficient funds for withdrawal

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the blockchain for CDS withdrawal signatures
2. Attacker captures a legitimate user's withdrawal signature with low excessProfitCumulativeValue
3. Attacker calls withdraw() using the captured signature
4. Contract verifies signature without checking msg.sender
5. Attacker successfully withdraws funds using someone else's signature

### Impact

The protocol suffers financial losses due to malicious users being able to withdraw funds using signatures with lower excessProfitCumulativeValue than intended. The profit calculation in cdsAmountToReturn() directly uses excessProfitCumulativeValue to reduce the profit amount, allowing attackers to maximize their gains by reusing signatures with minimal values.

Key impact points in cdsAmountToReturn():

```solidity
uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify CDS.sol:

1. Include msg.sender in the withdrawal signature parameters
2. Update `_verify()` to validate msg.sender matches the signature signer
