# `ABONDToken::transferFrom()` updates spender user state instead of sender's one

### Summary

The `ABONDToken::transferFrom()` function debits sender's balance, but changed user state assigns to the spender, instead of sender.

### Root Cause

In [ABONDToken::transferFrom()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L165) debited user state assigns to the `msg.sender`, so `ABONDToken.userStates` becomes out of sync with users token balances.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User allowed to spend some amount of `ABONDToken` to the spender

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User allowed to spend some amount of `ABONDToken` to the spender
2. Spender calls `ABONDToken.transferFrom()` with user's address as `from` param
3. Spender receives user's `State` in the `userStates` mapping

### Impact

`ABONDToken.userStates` becomes out of sync with users ABONDToken balances
