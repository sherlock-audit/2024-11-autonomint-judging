# Borrower-Set Strike Price Mechanism Can Lead to Collateral Losses for Users Under Volatile Market Conditions

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause


If borrowers deposit collateral into the protocol and mint USDa tokens, they can choose strike prices (e.g., 5%, 10%, up to 25%) to define the range of ETH price changes they want to protect against.  
- A lower strike price (e.g., 5%) results in a higher cost for the option.  
- A higher strike price (e.g., 25%) results in a lower cost for the option.  

```solidity
struct BorrowDepositParams {
    IOptions.StrikePrice strikePercent;
    uint64 strikePrice;
    uint256 volatility;
    AssetName assetName;
    uint256 depositingAmount;
}
```

The `strikePrice` value passed through the deposit function in the `BorrowDepositParams` struct is stored in `depositDetail.strikePrice` as follows:  

```solidity
        depositDetail.strikePrice = params.strikePrice * uint128(params.depositingAmount);
```

It's similar to the ETH price, as this `strikePrice` is set by the borrower during the deposit of collateral.


When a borrower withdraws collateral from the protocol and burns USDa, the borrower calls the `withdraw` function in the borrowing contract. Within the `withdraw` function, the amount to be returned to the borrower is calculated using the `calculateCollateralToReturn` function.

```solidity
            IBorrowing.CalculateCollateralToReturn_Result
                memory result = calculateCollateralToReturn(
                    IBorrowing.CalculateCollateralToReturn_Param(
                        interfaces.options,
                        depositDetail,
                        omniChainData,
                        borrowingHealth,
                        params.ethPrice,
                        params.collateralRemainingInWithdraw,
                        params.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw
                    )
                );

```


So, here the strike price is used directly, influencing the amount of collateral returned to the borrower by factoring it into the `calculateCollateralToReturn` function. This function adjusts the returned collateral based on several parameters, including the borrower's health, the current ETH price, the strike price, and any potential gains calculated by the options contract. This dynamic calculation ensures that the strike price chosen during the deposit impacts the collateral's value and return amount under various conditions, reflecting the borrower's predefined protection level against ETH price changes.

```solidity

    function calculateCollateralToReturn(
        IBorrowing.CalculateCollateralToReturn_Param memory params
    ) public view returns (IBorrowing.CalculateCollateralToReturn_Result memory) {
        uint128 collateralToReturn;
        //Calculate current depositedAmount value
        uint128 depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice;
        uint128 collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        // If the health is greater than 1
        if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000) {
            // If the ethPrice is higher than deposit ethPrice,call withdrawOption in options contract
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
            // increment the difference between collatearla to  return and deposited amount in collateralRemainingInWithdraw
            collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralToReturn;
            params.collateralRemainingInWithdraw += collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
            params.omniChainData.collateralRemainingInWithdraw += collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
            // increment the difference between collatearl to return and deposited amount
            // in collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw in usd
            params.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw += (collateralRemainingInWithdraw *params.ethPrice);
            params.omniChainData.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw += (collateralRemainingInWithdraw *params.ethPrice);
            // If the health is one collateralToReturn is depositedAmountvalue itself
        } else if (params.borrowingHealth == 10000) {
            collateralToReturn = depositedAmountvalue;
            // If the health is between 0.8 and 1 collateralToReturn is depositedAmountInETH itself
        } else if (
            8000 < params.borrowingHealth && params.borrowingHealth < 10000
        ) {
            collateralToReturn = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH;
        } else {
            revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();
        }
        // Calculate the 50% of colllateral to return

        collateralToReturn = calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) - collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        return IBorrowing.CalculateCollateralToReturn_Result(
                collateralToReturn,
                params.collateralRemainingInWithdraw,
                params.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw,
                params.omniChainData
            );
    }
```

If the current ETH price increases, the collateral ETH value for the borrower also increases because the ETH price has gone up. In this situation, the condition `if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000)` evaluates to `true`, and the function calculates the amount of collateral to return by calling the `calculateStrikePriceGains` function. 

Here, the `calculateStrikePriceGains` function computes the gains for the borrower based on the difference between the current ETH price and the strike price set by the borrower during the deposit. Specifically, it checks whether the current value of the deposited ETH (in USD) exceeds the strike price:

1. **If `currentEthValue > strikePrice`:**  
   
   The borrower benefits from the ETH price increase, and the additional ETH to return is calculated as:


    ethToReturn = (currentEthValue − strikePrice) / currentEthPrice 
​

2. **Else:**  
   If the ETH price does not exceed the strike price, the borrower does not gain any additional ETH, and `ethToReturn` is set to `0`.

This calculation directly affects the returned collateral amount (`collateralToReturn`) in the `calculateCollateralToReturn` function, reflecting the impact of the strike price and current ETH price dynamics on the borrower's collateral.


### Example with Step-by-Step Explanation of Issue:

- User sets the **strike price** at **$3000**, represented with two additional decimals as **300000** (per protocol logic).  
- ETH price **at deposit**: **$2500** (converted as `250000`).  
- Current ETH price: **$3500** (converted as `350000`).  
- Amount of ETH deposited: **2 ETH** (`2e18` in Wei).  

- [Strike price in the contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L754):  

```solidity
    depositDetail.strikePrice = params.strikePrice * uint128(params.depositingAmount)
```
>   depositDetail.strikePrice = 300000 * 2e18  -->>  600000000000000000000000



1. **Calculations in the [calculateCollateralToReturn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L472C2-L507C1) Function**


**Step 1: Calculate Deposited Amount Value**  
   
This step computes the value of the deposited ETH based on the ETH price at deposit and the current ETH price:  

```solidity
        //Calculate current depositedAmount value
        uint128 depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice;
        uint128 collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
```
> depositedAmountValue = (2e18 * 250000) / 350000 = 1428571428571428571



**Step 2: Calculate Gains Based on Strike Price**  

The `calculateStrikePriceGains` function calculates the additional ETH to return if the current ETH value exceeds the strike price:  

```solidity
       function calculateStrikePriceGains(
        //..
        if (currentEthValue > strikePrice) {
            ethToReturn = (currentEthValue - strikePrice) / currentEthPrice;
        } else {
            ethToReturn = 0;
        }
        return ethToReturn;
        //..
```


Current ETH value:  

> currentEthValue = 2e18 * 350000 = 700000000000000000000000
> strikePrice = 600000000000000000000000
>    ethToReturn = (700000000000000000000000 * 600000000000000000000000) / 350000 = 285714285714285714


**Step 3: Total Collateral to Return**  

Collateral to return is the sum of the deposited amount value and the ETH gains:  

```solidity
    collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(..)
```
> collateralToReturn = depositedAmountValue + ethToReturn
> collateralToReturn= 1428571428571428571 + 285714285714285714 = 1714285714285714285

    
**Step 4: Remaining Collateral After Withdrawal**  

The remaining collateral is calculated as the difference between the initially deposited ETH and the collateral returned:  
  

> collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH − collateralToReturn
> collateralRemainingInWithdraw = 2e18 − 1714285714285714285 = 285714285714285715

Converting to USD at the current ETH price of $3500:

> collateralRemainingInWithdraw * params.ethPrice = 285714285714285715 * 3500 = $966.54

---


The borrower loses **0.285714285714285715 ETH**, equivalent to **$966.54**, due to the strike price being set at a lower value than the current ETH price. This loss occurs because the strike price locks in a specific ETH value, and gains above this value are not fully realized by the borrower.


### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Strike Price Sensitivity**:  
   Users must carefully set the strike price during deposit to account for potential ETH price fluctuations. A small strike price increases the risk of collateral loss if the ETH price rises significantly.

2. **Unpredictable Market**:  
   ETH prices are determined by an external oracle, and users cannot accurately predict future price changes. Even if the ETH price is close to the strike price, the borrower may lose a portion of their collateral.

3. **Protocol Limitation**:  
   The strike price is fixed during deposit, but the ETH price is dynamic. This mismatch introduces the potential for collateral loss under certain market conditions.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev calculate eth price gains for the user
     * @param depositedAmount eth amount to be deposit
     * @param strikePrice strikePrice,not percent, price
     * @param ethPrice eth price
     */
    function calculateStrikePriceGains(
        uint128 depositedAmount,
        uint128 strikePrice,
        uint64 ethPrice
    ) external view onlyBorrowingContract returns (uint128) {
        // Check the input params are non zero
        require(depositedAmount != 0 && strikePrice != 0 && ethPrice != 0,"Zero inputs in options");
        uint64 currentEthPrice = ethPrice;
        // Calculate current deposited ETH value in USD
        uint128 currentEthValue = depositedAmount * currentEthPrice;
        uint128 ethToReturn;
        // If the current value is greater, then user will get eth
        if (currentEthValue > strikePrice) {
            ethToReturn = (currentEthValue - strikePrice) / currentEthPrice;
        } else {
            ethToReturn = 0;
        }
        return ethToReturn;
    }
```

### Impact

Misaligned strike prices result in significant collateral value reductions when ETH prices rise, exposing borrowers to unexpected losses.


### PoC


1. Borrower deposits **2 ETH** with a strike price of **$3000** (represented as `300000` in the contract).  
2. ETH price rises to **$3500**, creating a favorable condition for collateral appreciation.  
3. **Calculations in `calculateStrikePriceGains`:**
   - Deposited ETH value = `(2 ETH * $2500) / $3500 = 1.428571428571428571 ETH`.  
   - Strike price gains = `(Current Value - Strike Price) / Current ETH Price`.  
   - Gains are capped due to low strike price: `285714285714285714 / $3500 = ~0.285714285714285714 ETH`.  
4. Total collateral returned = `1.428571428571428571 ETH + 0.285714285714285714 ETH = 1.714285714285714285 ETH`.  
5. Borrower loses **0.285714285714285715 ETH** (~$966.54) due to the strike price constraint.


### Mitigation

Set minimum strike price limits relative to the ETH price at deposit to prevent unrealistically low settings.
