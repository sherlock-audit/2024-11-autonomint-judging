# Missing `lastEventTime` Update in Borrowing Liquidation Function Leads to Stale Cumulative Rate Calculations

### Summary

In the borrowing liquidation function, `calculateCumulativeRate` is invoked to compute and update the latest cumulative rate. However, the `lastEventTime` variable, which marks the timestamp of the last rate update, is not updated to the current `block.timestamp`. This omission results in the cumulative rate being calculated based on a stale time interval, which can lead to inaccurate interest rate computations.

### Root Cause

The `calculateCumulativeRate` function relies on the difference between `block.timestamp` and `lastEventTime` to compute the cumulative rate based on the elapsed time. Since `lastEventTime` is not updated after the function call, subsequent cumulative rate calculations continue to use the old timestamp, failing to reflect the actual passage of time.

### Attack Path

1. The borrowing liquidation function calls `calculateCumulativeRate`.

2. The stale `lastEventTime` results in a larger time interval between `block.timestamp` and `lastEventTime`.
3. The cumulative rate (`currentCumulativeRate`) is overestimated due to the inflated time interval.
4. Borrowers are charged higher interest based on the inflated cumulative rate.

### Impact

If lastCumulativeRate is overstated, the normalized debt increases disproportionately for the borrower.

### Mitigation

Update lastEventTime after Calculation:
Always update lastEventTime to block.timestamp after invoking the calculateCumulativeRate function.
