# borrowing::depositTokens - `calculateCumulativeRate` is called after borrower has been added

### Summary

`calculateCumulativeRate` is supposed to update `lastCumulativeRate` based on several factors like number of borrowers, rater per sec, last event time and the last cumulative rate. It's very important that the function is called in the correct places otherwise issues can occur.

```jsx
function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

In [`depositTokens`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L257) we call it after the user deposits and after `treasury.noOfBorrowers` is increased, this is an issue because the code will think that the newly added borrower has been a borrower since `lastEventTime`.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L257

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

No attack path, the function is broken

### Impact

The issue is, the code will think that the newly added borrower has been a borrower since `lastEventTime`, which will also affect `noOfBorrowers`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

First call `calculateCumulativeRate`, update `lastEventTime` and then add the borrower.
