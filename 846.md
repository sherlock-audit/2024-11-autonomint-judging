# The liquidateBorrowPosition() function lacks a check to verify whether the user still holds a position after their position is liquidated.

### Summary

The liquidateBorrowPosition() function lacks a check to verify whether the user still holds a position after their position is liquidated.

### Root Cause

The liquidateBorrowPosition() function includes two types of liquidation: liquidationType1() and liquidationType2().

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L270

However, both of these functions lack the following:
	1.	A check to verify whether the user still holds a position.
	2.	The operation to decrease noOfBorrowers.
```javascript
        if (borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0) {
            --noOfBorrowers;
        }
```
When the userâ€™s only position is liquidated, the number of borrowers should be decreased in the state.
```javascript
function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
       uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
@>             noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate; 
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
Since noOfBorrowers affects the calculation of interest, this will result in incorrect interest calculations for users.

### Impact

noOfBorrowers affects the calculation of interest, which will lead to incorrect interest calculations for users.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add a check to determine whether the user still holds a position and include the corresponding handling logic.
