# liquidations will not happen if collateral price of rseth or weeth goes down

### Summary

There is a substraction of collateral amount and value of that in liquidation in eth

### Root Cause

We can look at this expression: `depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)` which is the same for weETH and rsETH

```solidity
        collateralData.totalLiquidatedAmount += depositDetail.depositedAmount;
        // Calculate the yields
->        uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);

```

Lets look whats this values are from this code:
```solidity
        // update deposited amount of the user
        borrowing[user].depositDetails[borrowerIndex].depositedAmountInETH = uint128(depositingAmount);
```
From here        
```solidity
            // Calculate the depsoting amount in ETH
        params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;

```
[contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L655](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L655)

Sum up those to initial equation:

$$
amount - ((amount* exchangeRateAtDeposit / 1ether * 1 ether) / exchangeRateAtLiquidation) 
$$


$$
amount - amount * exchangeRateAtDeposit / exchangeRateAtLiquidation 
$$

This means if price at deposit more than price at liquidation there will be an underflow error when liquidation should be happening. Liquidation doesn't depends on price of weETH or rsETH its calculated in terms of ETH price decreases. weETH or rsETH will likely to decrease as well. You can look at graph comparisment of rsETH and ETH there will be spots where eth price and rsEth price going in different directions which where yield will be.

### Internal pre-conditions
Positions in weETH or rsETH their price drops compare to price at deposit and liquidation should be happneing

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Liquidations will not be happening when it should

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Handle overflow in calculation yield
```diff
-        uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
+        uint256 yields;
+        if(depositDetail.depositedAmount > ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)){
+            yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)
+        }

```
