# Incorrect Handling of Cross-Chain ETH Transfers Leading to Stuck Funds

### Summary

When a CDS user withdraws and there is not enough liquidated collateral, the system attempts to receive collateral from another chain. However, the current logic does not correctly handle the transfer of ETH, causing ETH to become stuck in the GlobalVariables contract.



### Root Cause

The process involves several steps where ETH and other collateral types are transferred between contracts and chains. The issue arises because the logic for transferring ETH is incomplete, leading to ETH being stuck in the GlobalVariables contract.

1. Requesting Collateral from Another Chain:

If there are not enough funds in CDS when users withdraw, collateral amounts are calculated to receive from another chain, and globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains is called to send a cross-chain message.


```solidity
(
    ,
    ethAmountFromOtherChain,
    weETHAmountFromOtherChain,
    rsETHAmountFromOtherChain,
) = getLiquidatedCollateralToGive(
    CDSInterface.GetLiquidatedCollateralToGiveParam(...)
);

interfaces.globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{
    value: msg.value - params.fee
}(
    IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(
        getLzFunctionToDo(params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain, collateralToGetFromOtherChain)
    ),
    IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(interfaces.treasury), params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain),
    IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(
        address(interfaces.treasury),
        ethAmountFromOtherChain,
        weETHAmountFromOtherChain,
        rsETHAmountFromOtherChain
    ),
    IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.CDS_WITHDRAW,
    msg.sender
);
```

2. Receiving Message on the Other Chain:

When the second chain receive the message it calls `treasury.transferFundsToGlobal` to transfer collaterals to `GlobalVariables` contract.  The GlobalVariables contract is supposed to send collaterals to the origin chain. However, if ethToSend is not 0, there is no process to send this ETH. The GlobalVariables contract only transfers weETH and rsETH . The logic to transfer ETH from the GlobalVariables contract is missing, causing ETH to become stuck. and there is no logic to transfer ETH from this contract.

```solidity
  function _lzReceive(
        Origin calldata /*_origin*/,
        bytes32 /*_guid*/,
        bytes calldata payload,
        address /*_executor*/,
        bytes calldata /*_extraData*/
    ) internal override {

        if (oappData.functionToDo == FunctionToDo.TOKEN_TRANSFER) {

        } else if (oappData.functionToDo == FunctionToDo.COLLATERAL_TRANSFER || oappData.functionToDo == FunctionToDo.BOTH_TRANSFER) {
            //
            treasury.transferFundsToGlobal([
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.weETHToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.rsETHToSend,
                    oappData.oftTransferData.tokensToSend
                ]
            );
```

```solidity
    function transferFundsToGlobal(
        uint256[4] memory transferAmounts
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
        // Loop through the array to transfer all amounts
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            // Transfer only if the amount is greater than zero
            if (transferAmounts[i] > 0) {
                address assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName((i == 3 ? 4 : i) + 1));
                // Transfer tokens if the index not equal to 0, since index 0 is ETH
                if (i != 0) {
                    if (i == 2) {
                        if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
                        IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
                        assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
                    }
                    bool success = IERC20(assetAddress).transfer(msg.sender, transferAmounts[i]); 
                    if (!success) revert Treasury_TransferFailed();
                } else {
                    // Transfer ETH to global variable contract
                    (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: transferAmounts[i]}(""); 
                    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
                }
            }
        }
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User who selected liquidation gains needs to withdraw to trigger the calculation of collateral amounts to receive from another chain. 
2. Collateral amounts (ethAmountFromOtherChain, weETHAmountFromOtherChain, rsETHAmountFromOtherChain) need to be calculated by getLiquidatedCollateralToGive.
3. ethAmountFromOtherChain needs to be greater than 0.
4. CDS contract needs to call globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains to send a cross-chain message.
5. Second chain needs to receive the cross-chain message and call treasury.transferFundsToGlobal to transfer collaterals to the GlobalVariables contract.
6. GlobalVariables contract needs to attempt to handle the received ETH without having the logic to transfer ETH back to the origin chain.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The incorrect handling of ETH transfers can lead to ETH becoming stuck in the GlobalVariables contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a different approach to handle ETH transfers correctly or prevent ETH transfers and only allow rETH and wETH transfers if possible.
