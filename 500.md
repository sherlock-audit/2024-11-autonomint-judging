# `calculateCumulativeRate()` is called in liquidate, but updating `lastEventTime` is nowhere to be seen

### Summary

`calculateCumulativeRate()` is used to update the cumulative rate on an action such as: depositing, withdrawing and liquidating.

The problem here is that `lastEventTime`, which is a crucial value in creating the cumulative rate is nowhere being updated in `borrowing::liquidate()`.

This will lead to a higher cumulative rate overtime, thus forcing users to pay higher interest rates - note that this will happen in every single `liquidate()`call.

### Root Cause

The root cause is not updating `lastEventTime` in `borrowing::liquidate()` after calling `calculateCumulativeRate()`.

If the last call to `calculateCumulativeRate()` happened 2 hours ago, in `liquidate()` it will calculate it correctly, but then if a user calls `deposit()` 30 mins later, he will call again `calculateCumulativeRate()` but `lastEventTime` will equal 2 hours and 15 mins in seconds, thus calculating a higher cumulative rate.

Note that this will compound more and more as time goes on, which will at one point become a very big problem given a bigger than intended cumulative rate, forcing the users to pay a bigger interest rate due to the cumulative rate being used [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L77-L82).

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `liquidate()` to liquidate a loan that's under the threshold.
2. Normal user then calls `deposit()` to create a loan, but `deposit()` invokes `calculateCumulativeRate()` with a `lastEventTime` that's not updated in `liquidate()`

### Impact

The protocol will have a bigger cumulative rate than it should have and this will compound as time goes on, thus forcing the users to pay a higher interest rate than they should have.

Note that this will occur on every single `liquidate()` call

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `lastEventTime` in `borrowing::liquidate()` after invoking `calculateCumulativeRate()` to have a correctly calculated cumulative rate in the protocol.
