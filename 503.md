# Not updating `lastEthprice` in `borrowing::depositTokens()` leads to a stale eth price

### Summary

We can see that `lastEthprice` is updated in the end of `borrowing::withdraw()`, but it is nowhere seen to be updated in `borrowing::depositTokens()`.

This is going to give a stale `lastEthPrice` to the next user which calls either deposit or withdraw in `borrowing.sol`, thus causing either the protocol or the user losing money depending on eth price movement.

### Root Cause

The root cause is not reassigning the eth price on `lastEthPrice` at the end of `borrowing::depositTokens()` as in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L700)

### Attack Path

1. User calls `borrowing::depositTokens()` to deposit collateral and take a loan against it
2. Time passes without anyone calling `borrowing::withdraw()` and a second user calls `depositTokens()`, but ETH has moved five percent down in the meantime, this will cause incorrect calculation of `netPLCdsPool` that is responsible for a big part of the logic used in depositing

### Impact

It may decrement `currentCDSPoolValue` instead of incrementing it as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L192-L196) or vice versa, which will produce a smaller or bigger ratio that is then used in the [if here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L661-L669), which may wrongly show that the protocol has enough funds to protect downside, but it may not actually be that case,

or the opposite, which is going to show a ratio below the `RATIO_PRECISION` and revert making creation of a loan not possible in this case, but in reality we have enough funds for downside protection, which further shows that not setting the `lastEthprice` on `depositTokens()` is a crucial mistake.

### Mitigation

Update `lastEthprice` at the end of `depositTokens()` as in `borrowing::_withdraw()`
