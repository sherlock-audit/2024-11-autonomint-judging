# Arbitrary Price Input in CDS Redeem Function Allows Exchange Rate Manipulation

### Summary

Missing price validation in the redeemUSDT function will cause a manipulation vulnerability for CDS treasury funds as malicious users can pass arbitrary prices to extract excess USDT.


### Root Cause

At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L404
 the redeemUSDT function (inturn called from redeemUSDT in CDS.sol) accepts arbitrary usdaPrice and usdtPrice parameters without validation, allowing direct manipulation of the exchange rate calculation:

```solidity
uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains some amount of USDa tokens
2. Attacker calls redeemUSDT() with:
   - High usdaPrice (e.g., 1000000)
   - Low usdtPrice (e.g., 1) 
   - Their USDa amount
3. The function calculates an inflated USDT amount due to manipulated prices
4. Attacker's USDa is burned and they receive the inflated USDT amount from treasury
5. This can be repeated as long as treasury has USDT


### Impact

The treasury suffers direct loss of USDT tokens proportional to the price manipulation. Using the example above:

- If attacker has 1000 USDa
- Normal 1:1 exchange would give them 1000 USDT
- With manipulated prices `(1000000 * 1000) / 1` they could extract 1000000000 USDT
- The attacker gains excess USDT while only burning their USDa at manipulated rates
