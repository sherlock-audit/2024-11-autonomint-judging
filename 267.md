# An attacker can increase `borrowing.lastCumulativeRate` much bigger without limit causing freeze of borrowing.

### Summary

Missing update of lastEventTime in `borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()` will cause freezing of protocol as an attacker will increase `borrowing.lastCumulativeRate` much bigger without limit.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L540

### Root Cause

- In borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate() function, lastEventTime is not updated.
```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
As you can see above, calculateCumulativeRate() function is public.

### Internal pre-conditions

- block.timestamp is a little bigger than lastEventTime.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- An attacker continues to call `borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()`.
- Then, lastCumulativeRate continues to increase. This leads to increasing of borrower's debt.
- So protocol can be freezed. 

### Impact

Protocol can be frozen by an attacker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()` function has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
++      lastEventTime = block.timestamp;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
