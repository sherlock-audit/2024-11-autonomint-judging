# `USDa` will be stuck in the `Treasury` when depositing `USDT` in the CDS.

### Summary

When depositing USDT funds in the CDS, an equivalent amount of USDa is minted to the treasury. This amount is not accounted for in the CDS but just minted and sent to the treasury.


```solidity
File: CDSLib.sol
420:     function deposit(
421:         CDSInterface.DepositUserParams memory params,
422:         mapping(address => CDSInterface.CdsDetails) storage cdsDetails,
423:         CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces
424:     ) public returns (CDSInterface.DepositResult memory) {
425:         // totalDepositingAmount is usdt and usda
426:         uint256 totalDepositingAmount = params.usdtAmount + params.usdaAmount;
///.    ..........


585:         // If the entered usda amount is eligible mint it
586:         if (params.usdtAmount != 0) {
587:             bool success = interfaces.usda.mint(
588:    @>           address(interfaces.treasury),
589:                 params.usdtAmount
590:             );
591:             if (!success) revert CDSInterface.CDS_USDa_MintFailed();
592:         }

```

The problem is that there is no way to remove this particular funds from the `treasury` and as such the funds are stuck without a way to withdraw.

This funds get large with time as they are minted every time USDT is deposited in the CDS

I'm not exactly sure what the developers assumptions are, but the minted USDa amount should be accounted for in the contract
