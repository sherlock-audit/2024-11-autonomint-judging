# MasterPriceOracle.sol might return stale prices

### Summary

the masterPriceOracle.sol contains logic that implements the AggregatorV3interface which eventually returns the current price for tokens from the chainlink service provider.  The issue lies in the fact that the logic that queries chainlink doesn't return the current timestamp of the price received which might be a stale price.  The vulnerability is further exploited because the protocol compares current price and deposit price in the calculation of borrowing health and in cases where the discrepancy is further from the tenable amount, user operations are hindered due to the lapses in prices gotten from the oracles.

### Root Cause

root cause is the MasterPriceOracle.sol#_price which fails to check if the prices are stale by returning and handling the timestamp

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L61-L95


```solidity
 return (uint128((priceInUsd * 1e18) / priceOfNativeInUsd), uint128(priceOfNativeInUsd / 1e16));
        } else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();// doesn't return timestamp
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
```

cds.sol also calls MasterPriceOracle.sol#_price through this function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L134-L136

```solidity
function getLatestData() private view returns (uint128 ethPrice) {
        (, ethPrice) = oracle.price(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE);    no response about the price state
    }
```



### Internal pre-conditions

stale price is returned by the chainlink oracle

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The function may return stale token/eth price data, leading to inaccurate calculations and possible Dos for users.  During withdraw. the BorrowLib.sol#withdraw function compares the currentETH price and the eth price at the point of deposit through calculateETHPriceRatio below

```solidity
 function calculateEthPriceRatio(
        uint128 depositEthPrice,
        uint128 currentEthPrice
    ) public pure returns (uint128) {
        return (currentEthPrice * 10000) / depositEthPrice;
    }
```
In a scenario whereby an incorrect eth price is passed as currentETH price.  The ratio needed for for withdraw might fail to meet the expected borrowingHealth needed for withdrawal leading to DOS

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add logic to return timestamp for prices received from the chain-link oracle and handle the timestamp to revert in scenarios where they are stale.


```solidity
return (uint128((priceInUsd * 1e18) / priceOfNativeInUsd), uint128(priceOfNativeInUsd / 1e16));
} else if (block.chainid == 10) {
    AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

    // Get the eth price
    (, int256 price_, , uint256 timeStamp, ) = oracle.latestRoundData(); // include timestamp and handle properly
    // Check if the price data is fresh
    if (block.timestamp - timeStamp > 1 hours) {
        revert("Stale price data");
    }
    // If the token is ETH
    if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
        // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
        return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
    } else {
        (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
        // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
        return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
    }
} else {
