# Incorrect token-to-eth exchange rate calculation in `_price` function

### Summary

The `_price` function in the `MasterPriceOracle` contract incorrectly calculates and returns the token-to-ETH exchange rate when `block.chainid == 10`. Instead of computing the exchange rate, it directly returns the token price fetched from the Chainlink oracle. This leads to incorrect price reporting, which can result in downstream logic or financial operations misbehaving.

### Root Cause

The `_price` function incorrectly returns the token price (`price_`) fetched from the Chainlink oracle as the token-to-ETH exchange rate. The correct exchange rate requires dividing the token price by the ETH price, but this calculation is missing. Additionally, thereâ€™s no handling for scaling differences between the token and ETH prices, leading to inaccurate results.

This returns too high value because this value used for exchangeRate.

This cause that user can get **Too** much amount of tokens, so this is very **critical problem**

### Impact

1. **Inaccurate Price Data**: Downstream protocols relying on the `MasterPriceOracle` will operate with incorrect token-to-ETH conversion rates.  
2. **Collateral Mismanagement**: Lending and borrowing operations may calculate collateralization and liquidation thresholds inaccurately, leading to potential insolvency risks or unnecessary liquidations.  
3. **Financial Loss**: Users or protocols interacting with the oracle may experience losses due to mispriced transactions or incorrect asset valuations.  
4. **Operational Disruption**: Any dependent smart contracts relying on this oracle could encounter logic errors, affecting overall protocol stability.

### Mitigation

Update the `_price` function to calculate the exchange rate properly:

```solidity
else {
    (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
    // Calculate the exchange rate of token to ETH
+    uint128 exchangeRate = uint128((uint256(price_) * 1e18) / uint256(ethPrice));
    // Return the calculated exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
+    return (exchangeRate, ethPrice);
}
```
