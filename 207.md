# Calculating margin with ETH price instead of sETH price will lead to DoS of liquidation type 2

### Summary
Calculating margin with ETH price instead of sETH price will lead to wrong result and DoS

### Root Cause

In [borrowLiquidation.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L357)
```solidity
        // Exchange sETH with sUSD
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );

        // Calculate the margin
@>>    int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        // Transfer the margin to synthetix
        synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);
```

Historically `sETH` is lower than `ETH` with a few % difference https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/seth/ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/
This will mean that margin value will be inflated, which will lead to fail when doing the transfer with  `synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
- Liquidation type 2 is initiated.
- However transaction will always fail because we use wrong price feed to make the margin calculation and its value is inflated.

### Impact
- Liquidations of type 2 will be permanently DoSed and make them unavailable, which may be critical, as borrower won't be able to be liquidated.

### Mitigation
Add feed to the oracle for sETH and use it instead of ETH, for margin calculation
