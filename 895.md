# Missing Storage Gap in CDS Protocol's Upgradeable Contracts

## Summary

A vulnerability exists in the CDS contract's upgrade mechanism due to missing storage gap variables. The contract inherits from multiple upgradeable contracts but does not implement a storage gap, which is necessary to prevent storage collision during future upgrades.

In its current implementation, the contract defines a sequence of state variables but provides no buffer space for future additions. This means any new variables added in upgraded versions will be forced to occupy slots that may already contain data from inherited contracts or existing variables. This limitation creates a serious risk during contract upgrades where new storage variables could overlap with and corrupt existing storage.

The impact extends across the entire contract's state management, as storage collisions could corrupt critical values like price data, balances, or admin permissions. This becomes particularly dangerous in a cross-chain system where state consistency is essential for security.

## Proof of Concept
Current contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L33

```solidity
contract CDS is
    CDSInterface,
    Initializable,
    EIP712Upgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
    IUSDa public usda;
    IBorrowing private borrowing;
    // ... more state variables
    
    // Missing storage gap
    // uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```

Future upgrade scenario that would cause corruption:
```solidity
contract CDSv2 is
    CDSInterface,
    Initializable,
    EIP712Upgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
    IUSDa public usda;
    IBorrowing private borrowing;
    // ... existing state variables
    
    // New variables would collide with inherited contract storage
    uint256 public newVariable;
    mapping(address => uint256) public newMapping;
}
```

## Recommended mitigation steps
```solidity
contract CDS is
    CDSInterface,
    Initializable,
    EIP712Upgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
    IUSDa public usda;
    IBorrowing private borrowing;
    // ... existing state variables

    // Add storage gap for future upgrades
    uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```

By adding a storage gap, the contract reserves space for future state variables while maintaining compatibility with the existing proxy implementation. This ensures that future upgrades can safely add new state variables without risking storage collisions or data corruption.
