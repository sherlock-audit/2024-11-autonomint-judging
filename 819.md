# Excess ETH sent during liquidation will be stuck forever

### Summary

Excess ETH sent during liquidation will be stuck forever in `GlobalVariables.sol`, because the contract will use only `_fee` value from `qoute()` - needed ETH amount to pay for cross-chain fees, remaining ETH will not be refunded to caller, and there is no function to withdraw funds.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L281-L291)

During liquidation, ETH will be sent to `globalVariables.sol`, but only quoted fee will be used by LayerZero.
```solidity
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain > 0) {
            // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
            globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: msg.value}(
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
                IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain),
                // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
                IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
                IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_LIQ,
                admin
            );
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Quoted fee must be less the `msg.value`. This can happen naturally, because admin has no control over fee calculation:
>Because cross-chain gas fees are dynamic, this quote should be generated right before calling _lzSend to ensure accurate pricing.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Admin call `borrowing.liquidate()` with `msg.value` = 0.2 ETH
- `fee.nativeFee` = 0.05 ETH, so 0.15 ETH sent to `borrowLiquidation.sol`:
```solidity 
CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo = borrowLiquidation
            .liquidateBorrowPosition{value: msg.value - fee.nativeFee}(
            user,
            index,
            uint64(ethPrice),
            liquidationType,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
```
- in `borrowLiquidation.liquidateBorrowPosition()` all received ETH sent to `globalVariables.sol`:
```solidity
globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: msg.value}(
                //...
            );
```
- in `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` `msg.value` is never used - and is quoted `_fee` if less the ETH sent, remaining ETH should be refunded.
```solidity
function oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains(
       //...
    ) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (MessagingReceipt memory receipt)
    {
//...
_fee = quoteInternal(  // for example, fee = 0.05 ETH, remaining = 0.1 ETH
//...
receipt = _lzSend(
            dstEid,
            _payload,
            _options,
            _fee,
            payable(refundAddress)
        );
    }
```

### Impact

Excess ETH sent during liquidation will be stuck forever in `GlobalVariables.sol`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add this in the end of `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()`:
```diff
+   (bool sent, ) = payable(refundAddress).call{value: msg.value - _fee.nativeFee}("");  
+   require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
```
