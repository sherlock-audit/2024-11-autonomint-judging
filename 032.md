# "Approval Mechanism in MultiSign.sol: Handling Pauses, Unpauses, and Overlapping Approvals"

### Summary

In the `MultiSign.sol` contract, owners can approve both `pause` and `unpause` for the same function in different rounds. However, when executing `executePause` or `executeUnPause`, only the respective mapping (either `pauseApproved` or `unpauseApproved`) is cleared, and the approvals in the other mapping remain intact.

### Root Cause

In the `MultiSign.sol` contract, when approving the contract functions for `pause` and `unpause`, an owner can approve the same function twice, i.e., they can approve `pause` while also approving `unpause`.

However, when executing `executePause` or `executeUnPause`, only the corresponding mappings' states will be cleared.

```solidity
    function executePause(Functions _function) private returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
        require(getApprovalPauseCount(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            pauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
       }
	function executeUnPause(Functions _function) private returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
        require(getApprovalUnPauseCount(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            unpauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

When executing `executePause`, the `pauseApproved` mapping for owners will be cleared, but the `unpauseApproved` mapping for the same owners will not be cleared and will remain. Additionally, owners cannot revoke their previous approvals until the `executePause` or `executeUnPause` steps are executed, which clears the previous round of approvals. Therefore, if `ownerA` approves `Pause` in the first round, but `unPause` is executed in the end, `ownerA`'s approval for `Pause` will remain until `executePause` is executed. This means that in the next round of approvals, any unexecuted approvals from the previous round will still persist. Thus, `ownerA` may approve both `unPause` and `Pause` in the same round.

### Impact

The impact of the approval mechanism in the `MultiSign.sol` contract is that owners' previous approvals for `pause` and `unpause` functions can persist across rounds, leading to unintended overlaps. This could cause confusion or security risks, as owners may accidentally approve both actions for the same function, or their approvals might remain valid even if the corresponding action was not executed. Additionally, owners cannot revoke their approvals until the respective `executePause` or `executeUnPause` functions are executed, making it harder to manage or correct approvals in a timely manner.

### PoC

## 

```solidity
//owner A ,B,C,D,E   requiredApprovals==3;
//Round 1  A(approveUnPause),B(approveUnPause),C(approvePause),D(approvePause),E(approvePause)
--------->Execute executePause:
The approval statuses of the owners become---------->A(approveUnPause),B(approveUnPause),C(),D(),E()
//Round 2  A(approvePause),B(approvePause),C(approveUnPause),D(approvePause),E(approvePause)
--------->Only one approval from C, D, or E is required to execute executeUnPause.
```



### Mitigation

Clear all approvals in the `executePause` or `executeUnPause` functions.

The original code is as follows:

```solidity
function executePause(Functions _function) private returns (bool) {
    // Get the number of approvals
    require(getApprovalPauseCount(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
    // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        pauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
   }
function executeUnPause(Functions _function) private returns (bool) {
    // Get the number of approvals
    require(getApprovalUnPauseCount(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
    // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        unpauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

Change to:
```solidity
function executePause(Functions _function) private returns (bool) {
    // Get the number of approvals
    require(getApprovalPauseCount(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
    // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        pauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        unpauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
   }
function executeUnPause(Functions _function) private returns (bool) {
    // Get the number of approvals
    require(getApprovalUnPauseCount(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
    // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        pauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        unpauseApproved[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
