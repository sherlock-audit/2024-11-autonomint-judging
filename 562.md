# `liquidationType2` Requires Admin to Fund Liquidations

### Summary

When the admin  liquidate a position using the `liquidationType2` function (short position in Synthetix with 1x leverage), the function incorrectly requires the admin to send the liquidation amount `uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH)` directly in ETH. This is a logical error because the liquidation funds should be sourced from the protocol’s treasury contract, rather than directly from the admin.


### Root Cause

The logical flaw lies in the `weth.deposit{value: amount}();` call, which converts `ETH` into `WETH` using half of the user's `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH` value. This amount, required for liquidation, is currently expected to be provided as `msg.value` by the `admin` when calling the `borrowing::liquidate` function. However, this amount should instead be sourced from the protocol’s treasury contract, not directly from the admin if the `depositedAmountInETH` of the user is large, the admin must personally send a significant amount of ETH to the protocol to liquidate that position.

```solidity
    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");

        // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000, "You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

        uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);

        // Convert the ETH into WETH
@>        weth.deposit{value: amount}();
        // Approve it, to mint sETH
@>        bool approved = weth.approve(address(wrapper), amount);

        if (!approved) revert BorrowLiq_ApproveFailed();

        // Mint sETH
        wrapper.mint(amount);
        // Exchange sETH with sUSD
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );

        // Calculate the margin
        int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        // Transfer the margin to synthetix
        synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);

        // Submit an offchain delayed order in synthetix for short position with 1X leverage
        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
            -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
            currentEthPrice * 1e16
        );
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The admin must manually provide the required `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH` ETH as `msg.value` when liquidating the position in `liquidationType2`.
  

### Attack Path


1. The admin attempts to liquidate a position using `liquidationType2` (Synthetix short position).
2. The protocol requires the admin to send the amount of ETH calculated as `BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH)` value.
3. The admin must use personal funds to execute the liquidation process, which is logically incorrect.
4. If the admin fails to provide sufficient ETH, the liquidation process fails entirely, leaving the position unliquidated.


### Impact

The protocol unnecessarily depends on the admin to provide this `BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH` amount of ETH for `liquidationType2`, which could delay or prevent liquidations from being executed.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `liquidationType2` to source the required ETH from the treasury contract instead of `msg.value` becuase when user deposit collateral these amounts are transfer to the Treasury contract, so protocol should used internally manage liquidation funds.
