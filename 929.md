# `Treasury.noOfBorrowers` can be set to 0 by looping wei deposit<->withdrawals and DoS withdrawals and reset borrower debt

### Summary

`Treasury.noOfBorrowers` is [increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L169) when a user deposits for the first time, as the index is 0. Then, it is [decreased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L269-L271) when `borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH` becomes 0, which happens when the last deposit of the user is withdrawn.
The issue with this approach is that when the same user redeposits, `noOfBorrowers` will not be increased, as `borrowing[user].hasDeposited` is true, but when this same user withdraws, it is decreased. Thus, it's possible to reduce `Treasury.noOfBorrowers` to 0, regardless of the actual number of deposits.

### Root Cause

In the `Treasury`, the number of borrowers is increased and decreased in different ways, leading to incorrect behaviour as explained above.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Protocol is working correctly with some cds deposits and borrow deposits.
2. Malicious user loops deposits and withdrawals of very small amounts to reduce `treasury.noOfBorrowers` to 0.
3. Two things will happen: 1) users can not withdraw their borrow deposits, as `treasury.noOfBorrowers` underflows when they try and 2) the debt will be [reset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L240) to 0 even though there are deposits that have accrued debt.

### Impact

DoSed withdrawals and debt reset for all borrowers, taking the protocol the loss and users are DoSed.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Increase and decrease the number of borrowers symmetrically.
