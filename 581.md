# Users may be unable to withdraw from CDS when they have accumulated a profit

### Summary

When users withdraw from CDS their deposited amount may have increased, making them eligible to withdraw with a profit. There is a profit if the cumulative value has increased while the assets were deposited. The issue is that this is highly likely to prevent users from withdrawing their deposits

### Root Cause

In CDSLib.withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq:884 the deposited amount with the profit is taken out of `totalCdsDepositedAmount `. This is problematic as only the deposited amount was initially accumulated to the variable. Therefore, when a user withdraws the amount deducted from `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, it will either be higher than `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, causing a revert, or the additional profit will be deducted from the profits of other users. Either way at some point a user will be unable to withdraw due to `totalCdsDepositedAmount` underflowing.

The same issue can be found in CDSLib.withdrawUser:713. There the issue has been attempted to be mitigated by setting `totalCdsDepositedAmount` to 0 if there is a possibility for an underflow, however, the mitigation is missing when handling `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount`:

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user deposits 1000 USDT, and `totalCdsDepositedAmount` is increased to 1000.
2. After some time they decide to withdraw, however, there has been a profit and they withdraw 1100.
3. The withdrawal cannot be executed as `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq` reverts due to an underflow.

### Impact

Users will be unable to withdraw from CDS.

### Mitigation

Make sure that `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount`, `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` cannot revert due to an underflow.
