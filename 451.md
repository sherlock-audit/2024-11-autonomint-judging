# Incorrect margin calculation in liquidationType2

### Summary

In liquidation type2, we will calculate the margin via `amount * EthPrice`. We don't consider the exchange fee in synthetix.

### Root Cause

In [borrowLiquidation.sol:350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L350-L359), we will exchange the sETH to sUSD. The sUSD will be taken as the margin in the synthetix.

In liquidationType2() function, we will exchange `amount` sETH to sUSD, and then these sUSD as the margin. The margin amount is calculated via `(amount * currentEthPrice) / 100`.  The problem is that there is exchange fee in synthetix's exchange() function. This will cause that the sUSD from synthetix.exchange() may be less than calculated margin. This will cause reverted because there is not enough sUSD.

```solidity
        synthetix.exchange(
            // sETH
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            // sUSD
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );
        int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);

```

### Impact

The liquidation transaction will be reverted for liquidation type2. We need to make sure the liquidation should work well considering that liquidation type 1 may not work if there is not enough cds owners who opt in the liquidation process.

### Mitigation

Get the output sUSD amount via exchange() function. Take sUSD as the margin.
