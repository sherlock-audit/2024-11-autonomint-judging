# Liquidation cds profits are not backed which will lead to insolvency

### Summary

Liquidation cds profits are [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L212) as:
```solidity
uint128 cdsProfits = (((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury - returnToAbond;
```
`returnToAbond` is just 10% of `(((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury`, so the line above become simply:
```solidity
uint128 cdsProfits = 0.9 * (((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury;
```
As the price as dropped at least 20% since the deposit, and the minimum LTV is 80%, there is actually no profit to attribute to cds liquidators, which means the USDa that will be given as profit to liquidators is unbacked and will be collected from other sources in the protocol, as the treasury holds USDa.

### Root Cause

In `borrowingLiquidation::liquidationType1()`, cds profits are unbacked.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower is liquidated as the price dropped more than 20%.
2. Cds depositors collect the profit, which is unbacked as explained above.

### Impact

The protocol loses USDa to cds depositors profit that is unbacked, not having USDa for other purposes that was reserved. For example, cds depositors that did not participate in the liquidation may not be able to withdraw due to the collection of USDa as profit that is not backed.

### PoC

See the links above.

### Mitigation

Add a profit backing from some source.
