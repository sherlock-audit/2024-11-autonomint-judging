# lack of access control in `transferFrom` in the `Abond_token` contract can lead to steal of funds and financial loss

### Summary

The [`Abond::transferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L147)
function does not verify whether the caller `msg.sender` is authorized to transfer tokens on behalf of the from address. This omission allows any user to arbitrarily transfer abond tokens from another user’s account without their consent, leading to unauthorized fund transfers and financial loss.


### Root Cause

The transferFrom function does not include an authorization check to ensure that msg.sender is either:
- The owner of the from address.
- An approved spender with sufficient allowance.
- The function directly processes the transfer without validating the caller's permissions:
```javascript
super.transferFrom(from, to, value);
```
This allows malicious actors to exploit the function to transfer tokens from any account to his own accounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls the transferFrom function:
```javascript
transferFrom(victimAddress, attackerAddress, value);
```
2. Since no authorization check is performed, the function proceeds to transfer value tokens from the victim’s account to the attacker’s account:
- The `Colors._credit` and `Colors._debit` functions update the states for from and to addresses.
- The `super.transferFrom` function completes the token transfer.
3. The attacker successfully transfers tokens without the victim’s consent.

### Impact

Any user can transfer tokens from another user's account without approval, leading to financial loss as abond can be redeemed against eth in `redeemYields`.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an authorization check:
```javascript
require(from == msg.sender || allowance[from][msg.sender] >= value, "Not authorized");
```
