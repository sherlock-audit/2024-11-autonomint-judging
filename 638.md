# Incorrect Sequence in `calculateCumulativeRate` Call During borrowing Withdrawal

### Summary

The `calculateCumulativeRate` function, which relies on the `lastEventTime` and `lastCumulativeRate` variables to compute the current cumulative rate based on the elapsed time, is called after these variables are updated during the borrowing withdrawal process. This sequencing results in the function using the updated `lastEventTime` instead of the value at the start of the transaction, leading to an inaccurate calculation.



### Root Cause

The `lastEventTime` variable is updated to the current `block.timestamp` before calling `calculateCumulativeRate`. This means the function uses the **current timestamp as both the start and end time** for the calculation, effectively treating the elapsed time as `0 seconds`. Consequently, the cumulative rate remains unchanged, as no time interval is considered for rate growth.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower initiates a withdrawal transaction.
2. The protocol updates `lastEventTime` to `block.timestamp` before calling `calculateCumulativeRate`.

3. The time interval (`block.timestamp - lastEventTime`) becomes `0`, and the cumulative rate calculation is effectively skipped.

### Impact

Borrowers may underpay their debt since the interest accrued during the elapsed time is not correctly calculated.

### Mitigation

Call `calculateCumulativeRate` before updating `lastEventTime` and `lastCumulativeRate`.
