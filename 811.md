# `calculateRatio` may revert due to an underflow

### Summary

When users deposit into borrowing.sol calculateRatio is called to check whether the CDS has enough funds to give downside prortection to borrowers. The issue is that currently it may fail to execute due to an underflow.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.calculateRatio here is how the ratio calculations are performed:

```solidity
        if (currentEthPrice > lastEthprice) {
            // profit, multiply the price difference with total collateral
            netPLCdsPool = (((currentEthPrice - lastEthprice) * totalCollateralInETH) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100;
        } else {
            // loss, multiply the price difference with total collateral
            netPLCdsPool = (((lastEthprice - currentEthPrice) * totalCollateralInETH) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100;
        }
        if (noOfDeposits == 0) {
            ...
        } else {
            currentVaultValue = previousData.vaultValue + (amount * currentEthPrice);
            previousData.vaultValue = currentVaultValue;

            if (currentEthPrice >= lastEthprice) {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue += netPLCdsPool;
            } else {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue -= netPLCdsPool;
            }
            previousData.totalCDSPool = latestTotalCDSPool;
            currentCDSPoolValue = previousData.cdsPoolValue * USDA_PRECISION;
        }
```

As we can see, `previousData.cdsPoolValue` is updated by the net profits/losses of the `totalCollateralInETH`. The issue is that it is possible for the price of ETH to drop to the point that the net losses are higher than the `totalCDSDeposited` amount, causing a revert when `previousData.cdsPoolValue` is deducted by `netPLCdsPool`. If that occurs, deposits will be bricked.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

For exmple:
1. The price of ETH has dropped from 3000 to 1000.
2. `totalCollateralInETH` is 1e18, `previousData.cdsPoolValue` is 1000 USDT
3. Users should be able to deposit as there is enough assets in CDS to provide downside protection for borrowers
4. However, `calculateRatio` reverts as `netPLCdsPool` is set to `2000e2 * 1e18 / 1e14 = 2000e6`, which is more than `previousData.cdsPoolValue`, causing an underflow.

### Impact

Users can become unable to deposit into borrowing if the price of ETH drops.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is non-trivial, calculate ratio should be able to handle situations where the price of ETH experiences significant drops.
