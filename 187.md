# borrowing::liquidate - `lastEventTime` isn't updated after `calculateCumulativeRate` is called

### Summary

`calculateCumulativeRate` is supposed to update `lastCumulativeRate` based on several factors like number of borrowers, rater per sec, last event time and the last cumulative rate. It's very important that the function is called in the correct places otherwise issues can occur.

In `liquidate` we don't update `lastEventTime`, so every time a liquidation happens the code will update `lastCumulativeRate`, but will not update `lastEventTime` so the whole interest and APR will be screwed, since it's not updated.

```jsx
function liquidate(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        IBorrowing.LiquidationType liquidationType
    ) external payable whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(2)) onlyAdmin {
        // Check whether the user address is non zero address
        if (user == address(0)) revert Borrow_MustBeNonZeroAddress(user);
        // Check whether the user address is admin address
        if (msg.sender == user) revert Borrow_CantLiquidateOwnAssets();

        // Call calculate cumulative rate fucntion to get interest
->    calculateCumulativeRate();
        // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);
...
```

### Internal pre-conditions

An admin has to liquidate a position

### External pre-conditions

A liquidation has to occur

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

We don't update `lastEventTime`, so every time a liquidation happens the code will update `lastCumulativeRate`, but will not update `lastEventTime` so the whole interest and APR will be screwed, since it's not updated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `lastEventTime`
