# Cds depositor profit is never taxed as the tax is only applied on the option fees

### Summary

Cds depositor generates [upside](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L665-L667) from borrows up to the strike price increase, but [calculates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L801) the profit on the difference between the deposited and returned amounts, which only [differ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L351-L352) by the option fees.

### Root Cause

In `CDSLib.sol:801`, the profit should be calculated on the initial deposited amount without considering the extra profit for the price increase.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Price increases 5% since a borrower/cds depositor deposited.
2. Cds depositor withdraws, not paying any tax on the 5% price increase.

### Impact

Protocol suffers huge losses by not taxing 10% of the profit.

### PoC

See the links above.

### Mitigation

Calculated the profit on the price increase since the cds deposit and the option fees.
