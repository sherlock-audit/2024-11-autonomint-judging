# `liquidationType2` will always revert due to transfering ETH from the borrowLiquidation contract

### Summary

When a user gets liquidated through `liquidationType2` half of their collateral gets deposited into Synthethix. The issue is that the collateral gets converted into WETH and transferred to Synthethix from the borrowLiquidation contract, which is not expected to hold any tokens, as collateral is stored in the Treasury contract.

### Root Cause

In borrowLiquidation.liquidationType2:341 an amount of ETH is taken out of the contracts balance and deposited into Synthethix. This will revert as borrowLiquidation does not store the collateral of users.

### Attack Path

1. A user has a deposit of 1 ETH and gets liquidated through `liquidationType2`.
2. 0.5 ETH must be deposited into WETH and transferred to Synthethix.
3. As borrowLiquidation does not hold any ETH the call reverts.

### Impact

`liquidationType2` will always revert.

### Mitigation

Perhaps the required collateral should firstly be withdrawn from the Treasury contract.
