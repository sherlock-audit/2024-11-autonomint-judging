# Possible failure to sync global data

### Summary

LayerZero's message is async. When messages are send from different chains at almost the same time, we will fail to update the global data correctly.

### Root Cause

In automint, we have some [global data.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/interface/IGlobalVariables.sol#L10). We will use these global data to calculate ratio, cumulative value, etc. 

If we change global data in ChainA, we will send one layerZero message to the other chain to update the other chain's global data. We make use of this mechanism to keep the same global data in both chains.

The problem is that this mechanism is easy to be broken. If we trigger transactions in different chains at almost the same time, these two chain's global data may be different.

For example:
1. `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` = 10 * 1e18 in both chains.
2. Borrowers borrow USDa token via deposit collateral 1*1e18 in both chains at almost the same time.
3. Both chains will send one message with `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` = 11 * 1e18 to sync with the other chain.
4. Both chains' `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` will be updated to 11*1e18. But actually, the correct `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` should be 12*1e18.

### Attack Path

1. `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` = 10 * 1e18 in both chains.
2. Borrowers borrow USDa token via deposit collateral 1*1e18 in both chains at almost the same time.
3. Both chains will send one message with `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` = 11 * 1e18 to sync with the other chain.
4. Both chains' `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` will be updated to 11*1e18. But actually, the correct `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` should be 12*1e18.

### Impact

Global data may fail to sync. This will cause that the global data's record is incorrect. All calculations related with global data will be incorrect. e.g. ratio, cumulative value.
