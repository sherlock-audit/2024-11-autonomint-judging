# `redeemYields()` will always revert preventing users from redeeming their yield

### Summary

When `redeemYields()` is called by a user to redeem their yield the `USDa` gained from liquidation is accounted for by reducing the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` variable in the treasury as shown below

```solidity
File: BorrowLib.sol
0978:     function redeemYields(
0979:         address user,
0980:         uint128 aBondAmount,
0981:         address usdaAddress,
0982:         address abondAddress,
0983:         address treasuryAddress,
0984:         address borrow
0985:     ) public returns (uint256) {

//////           .............
1000: 
1001:         // calculate abond usda ratio from liquidation
1002:         uint128 usdaToAbondRatioLiq = uint128((treasury.usdaGainedFromLiquidation() * RATE_PRECISION) /abond.totalSupply()); // @audit-issue this ratio is different as bond is not minted based on this value, hence it can be very small or very large
1003:  @>     uint256 usdaToTransfer = (usdaToAbondRatioLiq * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION;
1004:         //update usdaGainedFromLiquidation in treasury
1005:  @>     treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false);


File: Treasury.sol
422:     function updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(
423:         uint256 amount,
424:         bool operation
425:     ) external onlyCoreContracts {
426:         if (operation) {
427:   @>        usdaGainedFromLiquidation += amount;
428:         } else {
429:  @>         usdaGainedFromLiquidation -= amount;
430:         }
431:     }

```



### Root Cause

The problem is that during liquidation, [` treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1004-L1005) is not called to update the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` and as such when ` treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(...)` is called to do the accounting the function reverts due to an attempted overflow on L1005 because you are [subtracting non zero value from a zero value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L428-L429)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users cannot redeem their yield from the protocol causing their funds to be stuck in the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` during liquidation to ensure the users can redeem their yield
