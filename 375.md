# Incorrect totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei update in withdraw()

### Summary

In withdraw, we should deduct `depositedAmountInETH` not `depositedAmount` from the `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei`.

### Root Cause

When borrowers withdraw collateral, we will [update `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L920).
The `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` is the total collateral amount in term of Ether. When borrowers withdraw collateral, we should deduct the related amount in Ether from the `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei`.

The problem is that we use `depositDetail.depositedAmount`. The `depositDetail.depositedAmount` means this deposit's collateral amount, maybe Ether's amount, or WrsETH amount. This will cause that if this borrower's deposit asset is not Ether, e.g. WrsETH, we will deduct less amount from `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` than expected.

This will cause all calculations related with `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` will be incorrect.
 
```solidity
omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei -= depositDetail.depositedAmount;
``` 
```solidity
    function deposit(
        IBorrowing.BorrowLibDeposit_Params memory libParams,
        IBorrowing.BorrowDepositParams memory params,
        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        mapping(IBorrowing.AssetName => address assetAddress) storage assetAddress
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 depositingAmount = params.depositingAmount;
        ...
        depositDetail.depositedAmount = uint128(depositingAmount);
}
```

### Impact

After borrowers withdraw non-Ether collateral(weETH, wrsETH), the `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` will be incorrect. This will cause all calculations related with `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` will be incorrect.
For example:
cds's cumulativeValue will be calculated incorrectly.
```solidity
        CalculateValueResult memory result = _calculateCumulativeValue(
            omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei,
            omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount,
            ethPrice // current ether price.
        );
```
CDS owners can get more or less than expected.

### Mitigation

Deduct `depositedAmountInETH` from `totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei` when users withdraw collateral.
