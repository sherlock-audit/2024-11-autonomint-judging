### initialization timeframe vulnerability 

Link to the vulnerable code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L36

### Description
The `Abond_Token` contract exhibits an initialization timeframe vulnerability. Even though it uses the `initializer`  modifier, However, it must also be coupled with access control to prevent unauthorized initialization.
This means that there is a period between contract deployment and the explicit call to `initialize` function during which the contract remains in its default state. The `initialize` function also has a public state visibility and no access control, meaning anyone can initialize. 

### Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that during the initialization timeframe, the contract's initialize state is  left  visible to all, potentially exposing the contract to unauthorized access or unintended behavior.

### Mitigation
1. Consider restricting the `initialize` function by adding proper access controls.
2. Deploy the contract with a factory or deployment script that initializes the contract immediately after deployment to minimize the timeframe of the vulnerability.
