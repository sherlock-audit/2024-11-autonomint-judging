# Lack of a buffer mechanism when liquidating

### Summary

Currently, downside protection is only 20% and liquidation is happening when the ETH that was deposited at the creation of the loan against the current ETH price is <80%.

This presents the following issue: We know that crypto markets can be extremely volatile and there are periods in which for 1-3 minutes the price of ETH can drop 5-10%.

If the ratio was close enough (82-84%) and the price drops 10% in minutes, the lender will be at a significant loss.

There are mechanisms in protocols that prevent this and they implemented a so called buffer/margin that liquidates before the loan becomes a so called "bad loan" - etc a loan that is unprofitable to the lender.

A second scenario is possible - since the `liquidate()` is only callable by an admin, the admin needs to be constantly monitoring the health of every loan and instantenously liquidate whenever the loan becomes of a <8000 ratio, which is unplausible and will be unprofitable for the lenders even in periods that markets are not extra extra volatile.

### Root Cause

The root cause is a lack of a buffer mechanism that can liquidate loans before they become unprofitable for the lenders, as well as to a lesser extent that loans are only liquidatable by an admin (what if he is not monitoring the app 24/7, what if the admin is off or there is some event that prevents him from being on the computer?)

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

ETH price must go down to an extent of 5-10% in a matter of seconds/minutes, which happens on average every 2-4 months (my personal observation).

### Attack Path

1. User takes a loan against his ETH (priced at $3000 during deposit)
2. ETH becomes around $2530 and is soon to be liquidated
3. Due to a mass liquidation event, price drops in a matter of seconds to $2440, thus making the ratio 78% and causing a loss to the lenders due to the ETH being outside of the downside protection zone (which is between 80%-100%)
4. Admin liquidates the loan at $2440 and the lenders are at loss

### Impact

Lenders will be at a loss in periods of volatility in the markets

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add a buffer that allows liquidation at a value above the max borrow value.

Example - if a user can borrow 80% of his collateral at most, liquidate him when the collateral falls with 15% (etc 85% of the initial value)
