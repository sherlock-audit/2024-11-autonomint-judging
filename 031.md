# users will not be able to withdraw their funds due to underflow(collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend)

### Summary

users will not be able to withdraw their funds due to underflow `uint128(2 * feeForTokenTransfer.nativeFee + (feeForCollateralTransfer.nativeFee - collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend))`

### Root Cause

Whenever users attempt to withdraw, there may not always be enough ETH in the current chain, resulting in a request to retrieve it from another chain.
```solidity
                    interfaces.globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{
                        value: msg.value - params.fee
                    }(
                        IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(
                            // Call getLzFunctionToDo in cds library to get, which action needs to do in dst chain
                            getLzFunctionToDo(params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain, collateralToGetFromOtherChain)
                        ),
                        IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(interfaces.treasury), params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain),
                        IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(
                            address(interfaces.treasury),
-->                            ethAmountFromOtherChain,
                            weETHAmountFromOtherChain,
                            rsETHAmountFromOtherChain
                        ),
                        IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.CDS_WITHDRAW,
                        msg.sender
                    );

This amount is significant in case liquidation happening compare to the fees that protocol pays for layer0 to withdraw that amount from other chain, right? But this is exactly is what will happen when user decides to withdraw his funds:
`2 * feeForTokenTransfer.nativeFee + (feeForCollateralTransfer.nativeFee - collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend` underflow
```solidity
        } else if (functionToDo == FunctionToDo.COLLATERAL_TRANSFER) {
            // Define options with native fee required in dst chain
            // to transfer this collaterals using 'addExecutorNativeDropOption' with fee amount and this chain address where to get
            _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(300000, 0).addExecutorNativeDropOption(
                    // Since, we have 3 collaterals, we are passing native fee required for 2 OFT transfers
                    // and 1 native transfer,so we are multiplying oft fee with 2.
                    // Since feeForCollateralTransfer includes the fee with native token needed, we are subtracting the native token
                    // needed to get the fee alone
-->                    uint128(2 * feeForTokenTransfer.nativeFee + (feeForCollateralTransfer.nativeFee - collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend)),
                    bytes32(uint256(uint160(dstGlobalVariablesAddress)))
                );
            // If we need to get both the Collaterals and USDa from dst chain
        } else if (functionToDo == FunctionToDo.BOTH_TRANSFER) {
            _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(700000, 0).addExecutorNativeDropOption(

### Internal pre-conditions

Liquidation happen, user's position requires eth from other chain

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Users decide to withdraw their funds in cds

### Impact

User's will not be able to withdraw their funds, locked funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Handle underflow that will happen, im not sure why `collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend` is there in formula
