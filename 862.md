# Flawed Time Check in `getOptionFeesToPay` Allows Borrowers to Extend Downside Protection After Maturity

### Summary

In the function [BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L446C1-L451C57) this checks the user if he is renewing his options position in btw 15 to 30 days of last `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` but the ISSUE here is that this check will never ever revert due to wrong implementation, and therefore the borrower will be able to renew his option anytime before the withdraw (even after the 30 days maturity as has passed) and will enjoy the benefit of downside protection in withdraw. Which is an ISSUE, this should not happen., there is a check designed to allow borrowers to renew their option position only within 15 to 30 days of the last `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp`. However, due to incorrect logic, this check will never trigger a revert. As a result, borrowers are able to renew their options at any time, even after the 30-day maturity period has passed, allowing them to keep downside protection when withdrawing, which is not the intended behavior.

### Root Cause

The issue arises from the incorrect use of logical operators in the time check. Specifically, the use of `&&` (AND) instead of `||` (OR) results in a condition that is never satisfied, thus never reverting. This allows the borrower to renew their option at any time, including after the expiration of the 30-day window, leading to unintended benefits such as continued downside protection at the time of withdrawal.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The borrower has an active loan and has previously renewed their options.
- The `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` is recorded accurately.

### External pre-conditions

- The borrower attempts to renew the option after the 30-day maturity period.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower deposits funds and takes out a loan.
2. More than 30 days pass without renewing the options.
3. The borrower attempts to withdraw funds but is subject to downside protection based on the renewal window.
4. The borrower exploits the incorrect time check to renew their option after 40 days.
5. Despite being outside the allowed renewal period, the borrower can renew the option and continue enjoying downside protection when withdrawing.

### Impact

This flaw enables borrowers to extend their downside protection beyond the intended 30-day window, leading to a situation where they can pay less total debt upon withdrawal. This results in a loss of funds for the protocol and undermines the intended design of the option renewal process.

### PoC

- A borrower waits for 40 days after the last option renewal and then renews their option.
- The borrower proceeds to withdraw funds, benefiting from downside protection despite being outside the 30-day renewal period.

### Mitigation

To prevent this exploit, the time check in the `getOptionFeesToPay` function should be modified to use the `||` (OR) operator instead of `&&` (AND). This ensures that the condition will properly revert if the renewal attempt is made outside the allowed 15 to 30-day window.

Suggested fix:
```diff
if (
    block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days
-        && block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
+        || block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
