# lastCumulativeRate Not Updated  at start in Deposit and Withdraw Functions

### Summary

The functions depositTokens and withDraw  in  borrowing contract fail to update the lastCumulativeRate at the beginning of execution, causing inaccurate debt calculations. This allows users to deposit or withdraw funds using outdated cumulative rates, leading to discrepancies.

### Root Cause

`Deposit Function Issue`: When a user deposits funds, the lastCumulativeRate is not updated before calculating the normalizedAmount. This causes the deposit to be processed with an outdated cumulative rate with lower amount. This would result user paying more debt than expected.

```solidity
 function depositTokens(
        BorrowDepositParams memory depositParam )  {
        //

        totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
            BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
                LTV,
                APR,
                lastCumulativeRate,
                totalNormalizedAmount,
                exchangeRate,
                ethPrice,
                lastEthprice
            ),
            depositParam,
            Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options),
            assetAddress
        );

        /@audit lastCumulativeRate is only updated at the end 
        calculateCumulativeRate();
//
}

 function deposit(
        IBorrowing.BorrowLibDeposit_Params memory libParams,
        IBorrowing.BorrowDepositParams memory params,
        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        mapping(IBorrowing.AssetName => address assetAddress) storage assetAddress
    ) public returns (uint256) {
//

        // Calculate normalizedAmount
        uint256 normalizedAmount = calculateNormAmount(tokensToMint, libParams.lastCumulativeRate);

//
}

`Withdraw Function Issue:` During withdrawal, the lastCumulativeRate is also not updated before calculating the debt, causing the system to underestimate the debt, enabling users to pay less debt.

```solidity
            uint256 borrowerDebt = calculateDebtAmount(depositDetail.normalizedAmount, params.lastCumulativeRate);

    function calculateDebtAmount(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 cumulativeRate
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return (amount * cumulativeRate) / RATE_PRECISION;
    }

```



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates withdrawal with an outdated lastCumulativeRate.
2. The debt amount is calculated as lower than expected.
3. The user pay less  than they are entitled to.

### Impact

User pay more debt when they deposit and pay lower debt when they withdraw

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update lastCumulativeRate at the beginning of depositTokens and withDraw functions.
