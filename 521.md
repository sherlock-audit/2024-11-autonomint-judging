# Malicious actor can DoS admin functions due to lack of access control

### Summary

The [`multiSign::approveSetterFunction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L125) is used by owners to approve specific setter functions of their choice which allow the admin to set critical admin functions in `borrowing` and `CDS` contracts.
```solidity
    function approveSetterFunction(
        uint8[] memory functions
    ) external onlyOwners {
```
The [`multiSign::executeSetterFunction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304) is used by the admin functions of `borrowing` and `CDS` contracts to check the approval first to allow updating certain functionalities as well as set the approvals back to false.
```solidity
        // Example of how this function is being called in both contracts
        if (!multiSign.executeSetterFunction(IMultiSign.SetterFunctions(2))) revert CDS_RequiredApprovalsNotMetToSet();
```
However, this function is not restricted to `borrowing` and `CDS` contracts due to lack of access control.
```solidity
    function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {          <@ - // Lack of access control
        // Get the number of approvals
        require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```
Hence, an attacker can deny the admin from updating critical admin functionalities in `borrowing` and `CDS` contracts.


### Root Cause

In [`multiSign.sol:306`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L306), there is lack of access control which would allow anyone to call `executeSetterFunction` and reset the `approvedToUpdate` values to false.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Any of the owners in the `multiSign` contract calls `approveSetterFunction` to provide approvals for updation of a certain function.
2. Malicious actor keeps on checking the values of `approvedToUpdate` for all owners (which will be less in number) and at any time if it turns out to be true, he can call the `executeSetterFunction` to deny the owner from calling update functions in `CDS` and `borrowing` contracts.

### Impact

1. DoS of a plethora of admin functions in both `CDS` and `borrowing` contracts.

### PoC

Add the following test inside the `BorrowingTest.ts`:
```typescript
    describe("Testing Admin functions", async () => {
        it("Should allow anyone to set all approvedToUpdate to false", async () => {
            const { multiSignA } = await loadFixture(deployer);

            // Owner1 and Owner2 approve to update 1 and 2
            await multiSignA.connect(owner1).approveSetterFunction([1,2, 0]);
            await multiSignA.connect(owner2).approveSetterFunction([1,2, 0]);

            expect(await multiSignA.approvedToUpdate(1, await owner1.getAddress())).to.be.equal(true);
            expect(await multiSignA.approvedToUpdate(2, await owner2.getAddress())).to.be.equal(true);

            // Anyone can set all approvedToUpdate to false
            await multiSignA.connect(user1).executeSetterFunction(1);
            await multiSignA.connect(user1).executeSetterFunction(2);

            expect(await multiSignA.approvedToUpdate(1, await owner1.getAddress())).to.be.equal(false);
            expect(await multiSignA.approvedToUpdate(2, await owner2.getAddress())).to.be.equal(false);

        })
    });
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to consider adding a `onlyCoreContracts` modifier to `executeSetterFunction`.
