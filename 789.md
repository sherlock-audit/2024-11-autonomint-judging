# Cds depositor on chain B just after a liquidation happens on chain A will lead to stuck collateral

### Summary

Whenever a liquidation happens on chain A, a liquidation info struct is created and [sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L403) to chain B, so cds depositors of chain B can collect their collaterals and profits. However, if a liquidation happens on chain A and a user of chain B withdraws right after it, the omnichain message may not have enough time to reach chain B and this user will lose its [share](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L646) of the collateral. It will not take a loss because it can withdraw all the funds anyway, but the collateral will be stuck.

### Root Cause

Liquidation info is sent to chain B but there is no guarantee cds depositors will be there to withdraw the collateral.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidation happens on chain A.
2. Cds depositor withdraws on chain B before the omnichain message arrives with the liquidation information.

### Impact

Stuck collateral.

### PoC

See explanation and links above.

### Mitigation

Consider adding a mechanism to withdraw this collateral or similar.
