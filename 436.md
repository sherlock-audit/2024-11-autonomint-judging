# Lack of transfer Ether from the treasury to borrowLiquidation

### Summary

We miss to transfer Ether from the treasury to the borrowLiquidation when admin liquidates positions via liquidation type2.

### Root Cause

In [borrowLiquidation.sol:324](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L324), admin can choose to liquidate unhealthy borrow positions via the liquidation type 2.
In liquidation type2, we will use half of the deposited collateral from the treasury to start one short position in synthetix to prevent the more loss from the Ether price's drop.

In the liquidationType2(), we should try to wrap Ether to WETH and then start one short position. The problem is that we miss transferring the deposited collateral(Ether) from the treasury, after that we can wrap the transferred Ether to WETH.

Although function liquidateBorrowPosition() is payable, the admin only pays for some LayerZero message fees.
```solidity
    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {
    weth.deposit{value: amount}();
    ...
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin liquidates positions via liquidation type 2.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The liquidation will be reverted because there is not enough Ether to wrap the expected WETH. This will arise huge risk for the whole protocol because we fail to liquidate.
Although we can choose the liquidation type1 to liquidate positions, we should note that liquidation type 1 is not always available, e.g. there is not enough cds owners who opt in the liquidation process.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Transfer the expected Ether from the treasury contract. All collaterals exist in the treasury contract.
