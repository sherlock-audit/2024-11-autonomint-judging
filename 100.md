# Incorrect Collateral Valuation in Liquidation Logic Leads to Unfair Liquidations and Potential Loss of Funds

### Summary

The platform accepts wrapped ETH tokens (weETH and wrsETH) as collateral. However, when determining liquidation eligibility, the system only considers the last ETH price and the initial ETH price at the time of deposit, rather than factoring in the current exchange rate between the collateral token (weETH/wrsETH) and ETH. This flawed calculation can lead to:

- **Unfair Liquidations:** Users holding weETH or wrsETH may be liquidated prematurely, even if their actual collateral value, in terms of ETH, is above the liquidation threshold. This is because the value of these tokens relative to ETH can increase over time (e.g., weETH/ETH increasing by 5% in a year). The system does not account for these changes, potentially liquidating a user whose collateral is worth more than the protocol's calculations suggest.

- **Lender Losses: I**n cases where weETH/wrETH depeg or are manipulated, the reliance on the ETH price for calculating collateral value may lead to significant losses for lenders. If a depeg occurs, the actual value of the collateral is less than what the system calculates using the ETH price, resulting in under-collateralized positions and losses for lenders during a liquidation event.

### Root Cause

in "[borroLiquidation.sol:189](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L189-L191)" The liquidationType1 function uses only the initial ETH price and the current ETH price to calculate liquidation ratios. It ignores the dynamic exchange rate between the collateral (weETH/wrETH) and ETH. It is important to take the exchangeRate and calculate the collateral actual value in ETH terms.

### Attack Path

1. A user deposits weETH or wrETH as collateral.
2. The exchange rate between weETH/wrETH and ETH changes.
3. The user's borrowing position approaches the liquidation threshold.
4. The liquidationType1 function is triggered, and the liquidation calculation is performed.
5. The calculation only utilizes the initial ETH price at deposit and the current ETH price, ignoring the current weETH/wrETH to ETH exchange rate.
6. The user is unfairly liquidated due to the discrepancy between actual collateral value and the value calculated by the system, which does not account for the change in exchange rate.
7. Alternatively, in a depeg scenario, the lenders may face losses because the collateral value according to system will be overvalued while lenders liquidated only based on ETH price and not the real market value.

### Impact

Loss of Funds for Users: Unfair liquidations of users who hold weETH/wrETH.
Lender Losses: Potential losses for lenders due to inaccurate collateral valuation, especially in depeg events.

### PoC

### Mitigation

incorporate the actual price of collateral into liquidation calculations. Specifically, use the **exchange rate** provided by borrowing.getUSDValue to calculate the actual value of the user's collateral in ETH terms.
