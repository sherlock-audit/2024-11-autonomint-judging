# `borrowing::withDraw()` is missing slippage control when withdraw the collateral amount

### Summary


The function `borrowing::withDraw()` Withdraw Collateral from the protocol and burn usda, If the deposited collateral is ETH, the user will get 50% of the deposited amount for the remaining, ABOND token is minted and transfer to user which is fungible.

The half collateral return amount is calculate in the [calculateCollateralToReturn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L472) functin the return amount of this function is dependent on the `params.ethPrice` that is return from the oracle Due to not enforcing any slippage control while withdraw by users, it might `collateralToReturn` might return unexpected too low value causing users loss of collateral to claim if the `params.ethPrice` is impacted by the oracle price inconsistencies.



as oracle price fluctuates [collateralToReturn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L482C1-L487C19) can be impacted while withdrawal collateral, which will ultimately result in loss of funds for users.

```solidity
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
            // increment the difference between collatearla to  return and deposited amount in collateralRemainingInWithdraw
            collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralToReturn;
```

change in oracle price , (especially oracle price high, can decrease user's collateral amount), usre cannot control the oracle price or when oracle rate are updated

### Attack Path


depositedAmountInETH = 2e18 
ethPriceAtDeposit = 336417
params.ethPrice = 349029 

depositedAmountvalue = (2e18 *  336417) / 349029  --> 1927730933532743697 
collateralRemainingInWithdraw = 2e18 - 1927730933532743697 --> 72269066467256303

collateralToReturn =  1e18 - 72269066467256303  = 927730933532743697

The user lost 72269066467256303 worth of $244.48 at the time of the report simply because the ETH price increased from 336417 to 349029, This loss is somehow controlled by the `calculateStrikePriceGains` but it's entirely dependent on the oracle.


```solidity
        
        uint128 depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice;
        uint128 collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        // If the health is greater than 1
        if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000) {
            // If the ethPrice is higher than deposit ethPrice,call withdrawOption in options contract
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
            // increment the difference between collatearla to  return and deposited amount in collateralRemainingInWithdraw
            collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralToReturn;


            //..

            collateralToReturn = calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) - collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
```


### Impact


From the above function, we can see that there is no slippage control to handle the `collateralToReturn` which is being indirectly related to oracle price.

Impact: High (as user might face loss of collateral)
Likelihood: Low
Severity: Medium


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


We recommend to implement a check so that user can specify the min amount of half the collateral they will get when withdrawal colleteral more controll from over colletreal withdraw otherwise revert.


```solidity
    function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        uint256 minCollateralOut, 
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,          
        bytes memory signature                   
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {...}

        //...



        //....
        collateralToReturn = calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) - collateralRemainingInWithdraw;


        // slippage contorl here.
        if(minCollateralOut < collateralToReturn) {
            revert("too few collateral withdraw")
        }

        return IBorrowing.CalculateCollateralToReturn_Result(
                collateralToReturn,
                params.collateralRemainingInWithdraw,
                params.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw,
                params.omniChainData
            );
    }
```
