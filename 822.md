# Price Manipulation in `redeemUSDT` Function Enables Treasury Drain via Arbitrary User Input

### Summary

The `redeemUSDT` function in the CDS contract is vulnerable to exploitation due to the reliance on user-supplied prices (`usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice`). By manipulating these input values, an attacker can extract a disproportionately high amount of USDT from the treasury, leading to substantial financial losses for the protocol.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises from the absence of any validation mechanism or use of a reliable price feed to verify the accuracy of the user-provided `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` inputs. The protocol directly uses these inputs for exchange rate calculations, enabling attackers to manipulate the values and drain funds.  

Flow:  
- [CDS::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506) →  
- [CDSLib::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L382)  

Relevant code:  

```solidity  
function redeemUSDT(  
    uint128 usdaAmount,  
@> uint64 usdaPrice,  
@> uint64 usdtPrice  
) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(6)) {  
    @-> burnedUSDaInRedeem = CDSLib.redeemUSDT(  
        Interfaces(  
            treasury,  
            globalVariables,  
            usda,  
            usdt,  
            borrowing,  
            CDSInterface(address(this))  
        ),  
        burnedUSDaInRedeem,  
        usdaAmount,  
        usdaPrice,  
        usdtPrice  
    );  
}
``` 

### Internal pre-conditions

- The function is externally accessible and lacks any restrictions on the caller.  

### External pre-conditions

The attacker must possess a certain amount of USDa tokens to initiate the exploit. 

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls the `redeemUSDT` function, providing arbitrary and manipulated values for `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice`.  
2. These manipulated values are used to calculate the exchange rate for redeeming USDT.  
3. The attacker receives an inflated amount of USDT for their USDa.  
4. Repeating this process allows the attacker to drain the USDT reserves from the treasury.

### Impact

This exploit can lead to severe financial losses for the protocol, depleting the treasury’s USDT reserves and undermining user trust. 

### PoC

### Example of Exploit  

The calculation for determining the amount of USDT to be redeemed is as follows:  

```solidity  
uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);  
```  

**Example scenario with manipulated inputs:**  
- `usdaAmount = 100e6`, `usdaPrice = 1000e6`, `usdtPrice = 1e5`  
- Calculation: `(1000e6 * 100e6) / 1e5 = 1000000000000`

**Outcome:**  
The attacker burns 100 USDa but receives `1,000,000` USDT in return. This discrepancy allows the attacker to drain the treasury's USDT balance, repeating the exploit until the reserves are exhausted.  

### Mitigation

To prevent such attacks:  
- Integrate a trusted price oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to fetch the current USDa/USDT price.  
- Replace user-provided prices with secure, real-time price data from the oracle to ensure accurate exchange rate calculations.  
- Add validation mechanisms to verify the correctness of input parameters before processing.
