# `StrikePrice` should be based on `StrikePercent`

### Summary

Currently during `depositTokens` both `strikePrice` and `strikePercent` are passed as params, but the `strikePrice` should be calculated based on the `strikePercent`.

### Root Cause

The current implementation allows borrowers to specify an arbitrary `strikePrice` when invoking the `depositTokens` function. This introduces a vulnerability, as users can manipulate `strikePrice` to gain an unfair advantage during borrowing operations.

### Impact

During the `Options::calculateOptionPrice` it could be chose the highest percent so user can pay smaller option fee. But the `strikePrice` could be lower than the strikePercent, also the value could be lower than the current price. 

### PoC

Let's have the following situation.
1. Current ETH price is 1000$.
2. User makes a borrow request with strikePrice 1050$ strikePrice and 25% strike percent. 
3. In this situation instead of paying option fee for the 5%, user pays smaller fee for 25%.

### Mitigation

1. Remove the user-provided `strikePrice` parameter from the `depositTokens` function.
2. Dynamically calculate the `strikePrice` within the function using the formula:
```math
\text{strikePrice} = \text{currentPrice} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{strikePercent}}{100}\right)
```
