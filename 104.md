# Protocol fees won't be charged in some cases where dCDS user has opted-in for liquidation

### Summary
The protocol takes `10%` of the gains (profit) of a `dCDS` depositor, usually from the option fees accrued. However, during a withdrawal where the `dCDS` depositor is opted in for liquidations, part of the deposit amount is returned in ETH collateral, but the profit is not correctly calculated.  
This allows the possibility for the `dCDS` user to generate profit without the protocol taking its `10%` fee.

### Root Cause

In `CDSLib.sol`, the `calculateUserProportionInWithdraw` function is used to calculate the amount returned to the user and deduct `10%` for protocol revenue.

`dCDS` users generally generate profit from option fees and favorable liquidations, as they are compensated for risking their stablecoins by earning yield.
```solidity
    function calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(uint256 depositedAmount, uint256 returnAmount)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint128)
    {
        uint256 toUser;
        // if the return amount is greater than depsoited amount,
        // deduct 10% from it
@>>    if (returnAmount > depositedAmount) {
            uint256 profit = returnAmount - depositedAmount;
            toUser = returnAmount - (profit * 10) / 100;
        } else {
            toUser = returnAmount;
        }

        return uint128(toUser);
    }
```

The function is called during the withdraw process in 2 places, one in the withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq() case, and one in the case for liquidations opt-ins [CDSLib.sol#L800-L801](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L800-L801)
```solidity
                params.usdaToTransfer =
@>>                 calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, returnAmountWithGains);
                //Update the treasury data
@>>            interfaces.treasury.updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw(returnAmountWithGains - params.usdaToTransfer);
```

The issue lies in the `returnAmount` field, where the amount to be returned is passed in `USDA` without including the collateral. As a result, the `returnAmount` will almost always be less than the initial deposited amount.  

This causes the condition `if (returnAmount > depositedAmount) {` to evaluate as false, leading to the protocol missing out on the `10%` revenue, even though the user might have gained a profit.

`returnAmountWithGains` represents the amount without the liquidation amount that will be returned in ETH:
```solidity
                uint256 returnAmountWithGains = params.returnAmount + params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
                returnAmountWithGains -= params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount;
```
### Internal Preconditions
_No response_

### External Preconditions
_No response_

### Attack Path
- A `dCDS` depositor opts in for liquidation gains or buyouts.
- The `dCDS` depositor withdraws with a profit; however, since most of the withdrawn amount is returned in ETH (with other parts in USDa), the current logic only compares the `initial deposit amount in USDa` against the `amount to be withdrawn in USDa`.  
- As a result, the protocol does not take `10%` of the profits.

### Impact
- The protocol misses out on potential fees when a `dCDS` user who opted in for liquidations withdraws their position, even if they have made significant gains.

### Mitigation
Convert the ETH collateral to USDa (using the oracle exchange rate), sum it with the other USDa amounts, and then check for profits. Deduct `10%` of the earnings for the protocol.
