# "Logical Contradiction in Timestamp Validation Allows Bypass of Deadline Checks"

### Summary

The function [`getOptionFeesToPay`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L446C14-L452C1) on  [`borrowing.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol) contains a logical error in the timestamp validation condition

This condition is a logical contradiction because a single block.timestamp cannot be simultaneously less than 15 days and greater than 30 days from the same reference timestamp (depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp). As a result, this condition will always evaluate to false, rendering the intended validation ineffective. This may allow users to bypass the intended deadline checks and potentially exploit the function.


### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the logical contradiction of the condition:
```solidity
if (
    block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
    block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
)
```
#####  Why It Fails:
* Condition A requires timestamp to be LESS than (timestamp + 15 days)
*  Condition B requires timestamp to be MORE than (timestamp + 30 days)
*  Using && requires BOTH conditions to be true simultaneously
*  Mathematically impossible for a single timestamp to satisfy both conditions
##### Result:
* The condition never evaluates to true
*  The revert statement is never reached
*  All time-based restrictions are bypassed

This is a fundamental logical error where the developer likely meant to prevent renewals outside a specific time window but accidentally created an impossible condition through incorrect operator choice.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

### Understanding the Validation Failure:
The condition in the if statement will always evaluate to false due to the logical contradiction.
This allows the function to proceed even when the block.timestamp is outside the intended 15-30 day range.

### Manipulating the Time Constraints:
The attacker identifies that they can invoke the function at any time without respecting the intended restrictions on the timestamp.

### Steps for Exploitation:

* Wait for optionsRenewedTimeStamp to be set.
* Call the getOptionFeesToPay function at a timestamp that is either:
    *  Before 15 days from optionsRenewedTimeStamp, or
    *  After 30 days from optionsRenewedTimeStamp.
* The function bypasses the check and allows fee calculation or position renewal regardless of whether the time constraints are valid.


### Impact

####  Technical Impact
```solidity
 // Intended Behavior:
if (15 days <= timeSinceRenewal <= 30 days) {
    // Allow renewal
} else {
    revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
}

// Actual Behavior (Due to Bug):
// All renewals pass through regardless of time
// No time-based restrictions enforced
```

#### Economic Impact:
* Users can renew options at any time
* Can maintain 80% downside protection indefinitely
* Disrupts protocol's risk management model
* Potential manipulation of option premiums


####  Business Logic Impact:
* Breaks intended renewal window (15-30 days)
* Undermines time-based risk management
* Disrupts protocol's option pricing model
* Could lead to unexpected protocol liabilities

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

## Update the Condition
###  Replace the incorrect AND (&&) operator with an OR (||) operator to ensure the time constraints are checked properly
```solidity
if (
    block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
    block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();

```
