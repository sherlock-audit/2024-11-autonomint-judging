# Replay Attack Vulnerability Due to Insufficient/ lack of  Nonce Validation in  function withDraw of borrowing.sol

### Summary

The  withDraw  function in borrowing.sol contract  contains a vulnerability in its withdrawal mechanism due to absence of nonce  during the signature verification process. Specifically, the contract allows the reuse of signatures across different transactions without verifying that the nonce has been used only once, leading to a potential replay attack. An attacker could reuse a valid signature for a previously executed transaction, bypassing the intended protections and potentially draining funds or causing unintended behavior.

### Root Cause

lack of nonce verification in the signature validation for the [`BORROW_WITHDRAW`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L290)function, which made the contract vulnerable to replay attacks or signature misuse across different transactions or chains.

In the [`previous implementation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L898C1-L905C2) of the _verify function in CDS.sol, the BORROW_WITHDRAW function used the odosExecutionData as part of the signature validation process but did not include a nonce. The nonce is typically used to prevent replay attacks by ensuring each transaction is unique.

Without the nonce, an attacker could reuse a valid signature (for a previous transaction) to trigger a withdrawal on a different chain or at a later time, causing unintended or malicious withdrawals.



### Internal pre-conditions

 ##### Incorrect or Missing Nonce Handling:
* In cases where the contract does not properly handle or track nonces for operations like withdrawals, it could allow replay attacks, meaning the same operation (like a withdrawal) could be replayed multiple times using the same signature or transaction data.
*  Remember, that If nonces are not used ,an attacker could bypass protections meant to ensure one-time execution.


### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

#####  Signature Reuse:
* The attacker can reuse a valid signature from a previous execution , potentially causing the same operation to be executed multiple times. this open doors for reply attack opportunity . Without a nonce to track transaction uniqueness, signatures may be replayed across different chains or environments, allowing malicious actors to execute transaction

### Impact

* Replay Attacks:  this  allow malicious actors to perform the same action multiple times, such as withdrawing funds, without authorization
* Loss of Funds: repeated withdrawals of funds by an unauthorized actor.

### Mitigation

Modify the Digest: When creating the digest, include the nonce in the hashing process, making each transaction signature unique.

```solidity

} else if (functionName == FunctionName.BORROW_WITHDRAW) {
            digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        keccak256("OdosPermit(bytes odosExecutionData)"),
                        odosExecutionData, nonce
                    )
);

```
