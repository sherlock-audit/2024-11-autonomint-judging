# Malicious Deployer will Bypass MultiSign.SOL  contract Design, Affecting Contract Integrity

### Summary

 A malicious contract deployer can set requiredApprovals to 1   allowing any single owner to execute critical actions,  or set requiredApprovals to an extremely high value during initialization, thus bypassing the intended multi-signature security and affecting the overall integrity of the contract.

### Root Cause

##  Insufficient validation of the _requiredApprovals parameter during contract initialization.
in line 75 the [`initialize function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L75) 
The contract lacks a mechanism to update the requiredApprovals value after initialization. This means that any incorrect or malicious setting of requiredApprovals during initialization is permanent.
The initialize function is a single point of failure, as it's controlled by the deployer/initializer. This means that the security of the contract relies heavily on the trustworthiness of the deployer/initialize

### Attack Path

#####  Malicious Deployer Bypasses Multi-Sig (Setting requiredApprovals to 1)
#####  Goal: To gain unilateral control of the contract and bypass the multi-signature scheme.

* Deploy Contract: The attacker deploys the multiSign.sol contract.
* Initialize with Malicious Parameters: During the initialize function call, the attacker sets _requiredApprovals to 1.
* Unilateral Control: Because requiredApprovals is 1, the attacker, as the initial owner, can now execute any function that requires multi-signature approval without needing any other owner's approval.
* Malicious Actions: The attacker can now execute malicious actions, such as pausing/unpausing functions, updating setter functions, or potentially draining funds if the contract manages any.


* Vulnerability Exploited: Lack of minimum requiredApprovals enforcement during initialization.

* Impact: Complete bypass of the multi-signature scheme, potential for unauthorized actions and loss of funds.


### 2. Malicious Deployer Causes Permanent DoS (Setting requiredApprovals Too High):

* Deploy Contract: The attacker deploys the multiSign.sol contract.
* Initialize with Malicious Parameters: During the initialize function call, the attacker sets _requiredApprovals to the maximum number of owners (or a very high number) and sets the number of owners to the maximum allowed (10).

* Permanent DoS: Because requiredApprovals is set too high and cannot be changed, the contract becomes permanently unusable, as it's impossible to reach the required number of approvals
* Vulnerability Exploited: Lack of input validation and immutability of requiredApprovals after initialization.

*Impact: Permanent denial of service, rendering the contract useless.




### Impact

* Complete Loss of Multi-Sig Security: The primary purpose of the multi-signature contract is completely defeated.
* Unauthorized Control: The malicious deployer gains unilateral control over the contract and  manages any funds, 
*  Arbitrary Function Execution: The attacker can execute any function, including pausing/unpausing, updating settings, and potentially transferring funds if the contract manages any.

### Mitigation

##   Enforce Minimum requiredApprovals   in the initialize  Function:
```solidity

  require(_requiredApprovals > 1, "Minimum required approvals is 2");
```
