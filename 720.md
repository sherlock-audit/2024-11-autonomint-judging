# Precision loss in `Treasury.swapCollateralForUSDT()` causing loss of more than 0.01%

### Summary

This check in `Treasury.swapCollateralForUSDT()` 
```solidity
swapAmount = (swapAmount / 10) * 10;
```

Allows for precision loss that results in loss of more than 0.01%.

### Root Cause

In Borrowing._withdraw(), whenever `amountToSwap` is > 0  `treasury.swapCollateralForUSDT()` is called to carryout swaps.

The issue lies in `treasury.swapCollateralForUSDT()` where the below calculation is done by dividing before multiplying causing precision loss.
```solidity
   function swapCollateralForUSDT(
        IBorrowing.AssetName asset,
        uint256 swapAmount,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData
    ) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
        //? Differs from actual value used in backend, so changing the final digit to 0,
        //? in both backend and here.
        swapAmount = (swapAmount / 10) * 10;//@audit-issue precision loss. division before multiplication.
```


Now lets say:
-  `amountToSwap` is 1025. 
- doing 1025 / 10 will result in 102 remainder 5
- now due to how solidity truncates values during division, 102 * 10  will result in 1020.. so 5 is lost.

Now 5 lost in this instance is a lose of more than 0.01% and also considering the token here will be either WeETH / WrsETH which their 5 will be worth more than 10$... so i think this vulnerability qualifies as a medium.
