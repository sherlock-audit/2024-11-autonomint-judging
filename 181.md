# Excess msg.value sent for OFT transfer will be stuck in the contract.

### Summary
For every OFT message with excess msg.value the excessive funds will be stuck in the globalVariables contract, instead of refunded. 

### Root Cause
Usually users could send `msg.value` with a little bit higher amount to ensure transaction won't fail. And in some parts of the code we apply buffers, or enforce higher values that won't be needed, like in the case for `BOTH_TRANSFERS` when calling the [oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L300) function:
```solidity
     } else if (functionToDo == FunctionToDo.BOTH_TRANSFER) {
            _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(700000, 0).addExecutorNativeDropOption( 
                // Since, we have 3 collaterals, we are passing native fee required for 3 OFT transfers
                // and 1 native transfer,so we are multiplying oft fee with 3.
                // Since feeForCollateralTransfer includes the fee with native token needed, we are subtracting the native token
                // needed to get the fee alone
                uint128(
                    //@audit-issue here it should not be 5 but 3, but this value won't be refunded, because we don't have such mechanism, other cases with excessive values are also not protected.
@>>              5 * feeForTokenTransfer.nativeFee
                        + (feeForCollateralTransfer.nativeFee - collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend)
                ),
                bytes32(uint256(uint160(dstGlobalVariablesAddress)))
            );
```
We set the value to 5, even though there are only 3 collaterals. This forces the user to send more than needed, which might ensure the transaction won't fail, but the excessive value becomes stuck in the contract. This occurs because the value is set for the `addExecutorNativeDropOption()`, which drops the `msg.value` on the other chain, leaving the excessive funds stuck in the `GlobalVariables` contract on the other chain.

### Internal Preconditions

_No response_

### External Preconditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The OFT transfer drops wei on the other chain.
- The excessive amount of wei is neither processed nor refunded, leaving it stuck on the other chain.

### Impact

Excessive `msg.value` amounts will remain stuck and could accumulate to significant amounts over time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism to retrieve or refund the excessive funds.
