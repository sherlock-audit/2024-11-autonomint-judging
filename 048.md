# `ChainlinkOracle` doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

## Summary
The protocol uses Chainlink `AggregatorV3Interface` for mainnet interactions.
Chainlink Oracle doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

## Vulnerability Details
Current implementation of Chainlink Oracle `_price` doesn't validate for the minAnswer/maxAnswer values
```javascript
(, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
```
Chainlink still has feeds that uses the min/maxAnswer to limit the range of values and hence in case of a price crash, incorrect price will be used to value the assets allowing user's to exploit this incorrectness by depositing the overvalued asset and borrowing against it. 

## Impact
In the event of a flash crash, user's lenders will loose their assets

## Tool Used
Manual review
## Recommendation 
Consider checking if the price returned is not outside the aggregatorâ€™s `minAnswer/maxAnswer` bounds and revert if it is.
