# Malicious actor will replay admin signatures cross-chain enabling unauthorized access

### Summary

The absence of chain ID in signature verification will cause unauthorized access vulnerabilities for the protocol as malicious actors can replay admin signatures across different chains where the contract is deployed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L749-L755



### Root Cause

In `Borrowing.sol:754-756` the signature verification excludes chain ID in the signed data digest:

```solidity
bytes32 digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
    keccak256(abi.encode(keccak256("Permit(uint256 deadline)"), deadline))
);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin must sign a permit with a valid deadline for the intended chain
2. The same contract must be deployed on multiple chains with the same parameters
3. The same admin address must be set on both chains

### External pre-conditions

1. Block timestamps on different chains need to be within acceptable range for the deadline check to pass

### Attack Path

1. Admin signs a permit with deadline for an intended action on Chain A
2. Attacker intercepts this valid signature from Chain A
3. Attacker submits the same signature parameters on Chain B where the contract is also deployed
4. The `verify()` function validates the signature since:
   - The digest construction is identical
   - The admin address matches
   - The deadline is still valid
5. Unauthorized action gets executed on Chain B using Chain A's signature

### Impact

The protocol suffers from unauthorized access on different chains. Since this signature validation is likely used for privileged operations, an attacker could:
- Execute unauthorized administrative actions
- Bypass intended chain-specific restrictions
- Potentially manipulate critical protocol parameters across chains

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the signature digest to include chain ID:

```solidity
bytes32 digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
    keccak256(abi.encode(
        keccak256("Permit(uint256 deadline,uint256 chainId)"),
        deadline,
        block.chainid
    ))
);
```

This ensures signatures are chain-specific and cannot be replayed across different networks.
