# Chainlink's oracle is used incorrectly, resulting in inaccurate prices.

### Summary

The protocol supports two oracles: Redstone and Chainlink. Chainlink is only supported on the Optimism chain, and the issue lies in price validation, as there is no validation for either the received price or its staleness.

### Root Cause

As shown here: [[MasterPriceOracle.sol#L80-L92](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L80-L92)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L80-L92), the price is retrieved from the Chainlink aggregator contract. However, there is no validation to ensure that the price is greater than 0 or that it is not stale (no `updatedAt` validation).

### Internal pre-conditions

Contract deployed on Optimism chain.

### External pre-conditions

Chainlink returns incorrect/stale price.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Protocol would use incorrect or stale price opening big vector of attack that comes with market price/provided price discrepancy.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add default validation for the price to ensure that:

- The price is not 0.
- The price is not stale.
