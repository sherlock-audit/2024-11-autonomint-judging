# Missing Liquidation Check in Option Renewal Function Results in Potential User Loss

### Summary

The ``renewOptions`` function in the ``borrowing.sol`` contract does not properly account for the possibility that a user's position may become liquidated before the transactions are added to the block. This flaw arises because the ``depositDetail.liquidated`` status is not checked before the option renewal proceeds. If the position is liquidated during this time, the user is still charged for the renewal fees, leading to a financial loss.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L560The root cause of this issue is the lack of a check for ``depositDetail.liquidated`` before processing the renewal of options. If the user's position becomes ``liquidatable`` due to price fluctuations between the initiation and execution of the transaction, the option renewal process might occur on a liquidated position, causing the user to pay for a service they no longer benefit from.

### Internal pre-conditions

The user's position is initially not liquidated at the time of initiating the option renewal.

### External pre-conditions

- The liquidation status of the user's position can change due to price fluctuations during the execution window.
-  The ``renewOptions`` function is called without verifying if the user's position is liquidated, allowing the option renewal to proceed even after liquidation.

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates the option renewal by calling ``renewOptions``.
2. Due to fluctuations in the asset price or other market factors, the user's position becomes ``liquidatable`` between the initiation and execution of the transaction.
3. The ``depositDetail.liquidated`` status is not checked during the execution of the renewal process, so the userâ€™s renewal proceeds despite the liquidation.
4. As a result, the user pays the option renewal fees for a liquidated position, leading to a financial loss.

### Impact

The user can lose funds due to being charged for an option renewal on a liquidated position, which provides no benefit to them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- **Add a Liquidation Check**: Before processing the option renewal, ensure that the ``depositDetail.liquidated`` status is checked.
- **Reject Renewals for Liquidated Positions**: If the position is found to be liquidated, reject the renewal with a specific error message to avoid charging the user for the renewal fee.
