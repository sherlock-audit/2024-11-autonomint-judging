# Users can open empty positions and trick the protocol into believing there are borrowers

### Summary

Due to the lack of check for minimum amount of tokens deposited in `borrowing.sol` it is possible for users to open empty positions and begin the increase the cumulative rate

### Root Cause

In `borrowing.sol::depostiTokens` if USDa is used as collateral and its price is <1$ (since the token is soft pegged it is completely normal for that to happen) and the `depositAmount` is 000001 USDa (USDA has 6 decimals), the resulting calculation:

will return 0 bypassing the depositing amount not 0 check. Afterwards the amount of borrowers will get incremented from 0 to 1 and in `calculateCumulativeRate`, the  protocol will be calculating as if there is a borrower and funds in it.

When liquidating the position the protocol will also loose out on fees and pay unnecessary gas prices also altering the the `noOfLiquidations` calculation.

The position can also never be withdrawn because there is a non 0 withdrawal check

### Internal pre-conditions

1. No borrowers in the protocol

### External pre-conditions

1. Price of USDa is less than 1USD

### Attack Path

1. User calls `borrowing::depositTokens()` with 1USDa 

### Impact

Protocol suffers losses due to artificially increased `cumulativeRate` and loss of fees and paying gas while liquidating the empty positions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check that the `depositingAmount` is not 0 after converting it.
