# "Bank Run" Risk in The protocol due CDS and Borrowing Withdrawal Mechanism

### Summary

The current [`Borrowing`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L874) withdrawal mechanism provides borrowers with `downsideProtection` if they withdraw just before `liquidation.` This incentivizes a "bank run" scenario during falling ETH prices, as borrowers rush to withdraw early to secure their protection., to make it more dangerous The current `CDS` withdrawal mechanism allows users to withdraw their full entitled amount on a first-come, first-serve basis. When the `downsideProtected` amount becomes significant, late withdrawers may find insufficient funds remaining in the protocol. This creates a "bank run" scenario where users are incentivized to withdraw early, destabilizing the system and leaving late withdrawers with nothing. The protocol lacks a mechanism to proportionally reduce all withdrawals based on the `downsideProtected` amount, exacerbating the issue. this incentivizes a "bank run" scenario for the cds users to secure thei deposits, this scenario puts the whole Protocol at risk.


### Root Cause

Borrowers have full immunity until liquidation which incentivizes a bank run scenario.
The protocol processes withdrawals in the order they are requested, without considering the remaining funds or the `downsideProtected` amount.
Withdrawals are not adjusted proportionally when the protocolâ€™s funds are insufficient to cover all users' claims.

### Impact

The protocol faces a "bank run" scenario where users prioritize early withdrawals, destabilizing the system. cds User are more open to the risk when Eth's price is falling.


### PoC

After multiple Withdrawals, `downsideProtected` grows bigger, After the `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount -= omniChainData.downsideProtected;` the total Amount available for cds Users decreases, since the withdrawal system is on first come first serve basis, the incentivizes a bank run leaving the protocol dry, and some users are unable to cash out

### Mitigation

The mitigation is hard, the downsideProtection shouldn't cover 100% of the Collateral at first to let users wait for eth price to go back up, for cds users remove the downsideProtection proportionally to the depositedAmount
