# Borrowers can pay less borrow interest because of `lastEventTime` early update in _withdraw

### Summary

`lastEventTime`'s update is before `calculateCumulativeRate`. This will cause that protocol will lose some borrow interest.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing:_withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L701-L704), we will calculate the cumulative rate.

When we check _withdraw() function, we update `lastEventTime` and then calculate the cumulative rate. In function `calculateCumulativeRate`, the cumulative rate is related with the time slot between `lastEventTime` and `block.timestamp`. But we update the `lastEventTime` to block.timestamp at first. This will cause that last period's borrow interest will be 0.

```solidity
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
        // update the borrow interest.
        calculateCumulativeRate();
```
```solidity
            uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
```
