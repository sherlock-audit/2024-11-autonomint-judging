# Incorrect Handling of noOfBorrowers Leading to DOS

### Summary

When a user deposits to the borrowing contract,` treasury.deposit` is called, and noOfBorrowers is increased if hasDeposited is false. When the borrower repays the debt and `treasury.withdraw `is called, noOfBorrowers is decreased if depositedAmountInETH is 0. The issue arises when a user deposits and withdraws multiple times, causing noOfBorrowers to only decrease because hasDeposited remains true. This can lead to an underflow error, potentially preventing users from withdrawing and repaying their debt.



### Root Cause

The noOfBorrowers counter is not correctly managed when users deposit and withdraw multiple times. Specifically, noOfBorrowers only decreases when depositedAmountInETH is 0, but does not increase correctly if users add new deposit because hasDeposited is already true. Using this  a malicious user can deposit and withdraw multiple times to make noOfBorrowers 0 which would prevent other users withdraw.

```solidity
    function deposit(
    ) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (DepositResult memory) {
        uint64 borrowerIndex;
        //check if borrower is depositing for the first time or not
        if (!borrowing[user].hasDeposited) {
            //change borrowerindex to 1
            borrowerIndex = borrowing[user].borrowerIndex = 1;

            //change hasDeposited bool to true after first deposit
            borrowing[user].hasDeposited = true;
            ++noOfBorrowers;
        } else {}

        borrowing[user].depositedAmountInETH += depositingAmount;

}


    function withdraw(
        address borrower,
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 index
    ) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (bool) {


        borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH -= depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH;
        // if user has no deposited collaterals then decrement number of borrowers
        if (borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0) {
            --noOfBorrowers;
        }
}

```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User deposits an amount to the borrowing contract.
2. treasury.deposit is called, and noOfBorrowers is increased if hasDeposited is false.
3. User withdraws the amount, causing noOfBorrowers to decrease if depositedAmountInETH is 0.
4. User repeats the deposit and withdraw process multiple times.
5. noOfBorrowers continues to decrease but does not increase correctly.
6. Eventually, noOfBorrowers reaches 0, causing an underflow error.
7. This prevents other users from withdrawing and repaying their debt due to the underflow error.

### Impact

Denial of service, preventing users from withdrawing and repaying their debt.

### Mitigation

Uptade hasDeposited when user deposit is 0

```solidity
        if (borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0) {
            --noOfBorrowers;
            borrowing[user].hasDeposited = false;

        }
```
