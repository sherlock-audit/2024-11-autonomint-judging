# Redeem yield exploit using different account

### Summary

The redeemYields function in the borrowing contract allows users to specify a different user address for redeeming yields while burning ABOND tokens from the caller's balance. This can be exploited to claim more ETH from the contract than intended. 

### Root Cause

The `redeemYields` function does not verify that the caller (msg.sender) is the same as the user address specified for redeeming yields. This allows users to redeem yields on behalf of another user while burning their own ABOND tokens.

If caller specify different address with same balance but lower `userState.cumulativeRate`, user can claim more yields than expected from `withdrawFromExternalProtocol`. After that abond is burned from caller which has lower yields. So specified address can still redeem yield again with higher yields.

```solidity
 function redeemYields(
        address user,
    ) public returns (uint256) {
 
        // get user abond state
        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);

        // @audit using input address data
        uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

        //Burn the abond from user
        bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount);
        return withdrawAmount;
    }
```

```solidity
 // TREAUSRY CONTRACT
    function withdrawFromExternalProtocol(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
        uint256 redeemAmount = withdrawFromIonicByUser(user, aBondAmount);
        (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        return redeemAmount;
    }

    function withdrawFromIonicByUser(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) internal nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentExchangeRate = ionic.exchangeRateCurrent();
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = _calculateCumulativeRate(currentExchangeRate, Protocol.Ionic);

        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
        uint128 depositedAmount = (aBondAmount * userState.ethBacked) / PRECISION;
        uint256 normalizedAmount = (depositedAmount * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / userState.cumulativeRate;

        //withdraw amount
        uint256 amount = (currentCumulativeRate * normalizedAmount) / CUMULATIVE_PRECISION;
        // withdraw from ionic
        ionic.redeemUnderlying(amount);
        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].totalCreditedTokens = ionic.balanceOf(address(this));
        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].exchangeRate = currentExchangeRate;
        // convert weth to eth
        WETH.withdraw(amount);
        return amount;
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User has two wallets, A and B.
2. Wallet A has ABOND tokens minted earlier with a lower cumulative rate.
3. Wallet B has ABOND tokens minted later with a higher cumulative rate.
4. User calls redeemYields with Wallet B, specifying Wallet A as the user.
5. The function calculates the yield based on Wallet A's cumulative rate but burns ABOND tokens from Wallet B.
6. Wallet A can still claim the same yield later, effectively allowing the user to claim more ETH than intended.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows users to exploit the yield redemption process and redeem more yields

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the redeemYields function to ensure that the caller is the same as the user address specified for redeeming yields.
