# CDS owners may fail to withdraw because getOptionsFeesProportions() may be reverted.

### Summary

Missing `downsideProtected` update may cause getOptionsFeesProportions() function reverted.

### Root Cause

When borrowers withdraw collateral, there will be some downsideProtected amount if the current Ether price is lower than the deposited Ether price. We will record the `downsideProtected` in the [global chain variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L873-L875) and [local chain variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L737). 

The problem is that we may skip `downsideProtected` variable's update in local chain. In _getDownsideFromCDS() function, if there is not enough cds deposit amount in this chain, we will transfer some usda from the other chain to this chain, and not update `downsideProtected`. This will cause that global chain's delta downsideProtected value is different with this chain's delta downsideProtected.

When cds owners withdraw, we will deduct `omnichain.downsideProtected(200 USD, e.g.)` from the `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount` and deduct `downsideProtected(0 USD, e.g.)` from the `totalCdsDepositedAmount`. This will cause that `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount` may be less that chain A's `totalCdsDepositedAmount` plus ChainB's `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.

When cds owners withdraw, function getOptionsFeesProportions() will be triggered. We use `otherChainCDSAmount = _totalGlobalCdsDepositedAmount - _totalCdsDepositedAmount;` to calculate the other chain's cds deposit amount. This formula will be correct based on one assumption: total global cds deposit amount = chain A cds deposit amount + chain B cds deposit amount. But this assumption may be broken based on above analysis.

For example:
1. Alice deposits 2000 USDT/USDA in Chain A. Total cds deposit in Chain A is 2000 U. Global total cds deposit amount is 2000 U.
2. Bob borrows 1000 USDA in Chain B.
3. Ether price decreases.
4. Bob withdraw his collateral in ChainB, there will be some downsideProtected(100 U, e.g.) in this withdrawal. Update `omniChainData.downsideProtected` to 100. `downsideProtected` in ChainB will keep 0.
5.  Alice wants to withdraw her position, now `totalGlobalCdsDepositedAmount` is 1900 U, but `totalCdsDepositedAmount` in ChainA is 2000 U. This will cause reverted. Alice cannot withdraw her funds.

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail,

        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces
    ) external returns (IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Result memory) {
                if (downsideProtected > 0) {
                    omniChainData.downsideProtected += downsideProtected;
                }
}
    function _getDownsideFromCDS(
        uint128 downsideProtected,
        uint256 feeForOFT
    ) internal {
        if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
            // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
            ...
        } else {
@>            cds.updateDownsideProtected(downsideProtected);
        }
```
```solidity
    function getOptionsFeesProportions(
        uint256 optionsFees, // the option fee that one cds owner wants to withdraw.
        uint256 _totalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 _totalGlobalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 _totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees,
        uint256 _totalGlobalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 otherChainCDSAmount = _totalGlobalCdsDepositedAmount - _totalCdsDepositedAmount;
}

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 2000 USDT/USDA in Chain A. Total cds deposit in Chain A is 2000 U. Global total cds deposit amount is 2000 U.
2. Bob borrows 1000 USDA in Chain B.
3. Ether price decreases.
4. Bob withdraw his collateral in ChainB, there will be some downsideProtected(100 U, e.g.) in this withdrawal. Update `omniChainData.downsideProtected` to 100. `downsideProtected` in ChainB will keep 0.
5.  Alice wants to withdraw her position, now `totalGlobalCdsDepositedAmount` is 1900 U, but `totalCdsDepositedAmount` in ChainA is 2000 U. This will cause reverted. Alice cannot withdraw her funds.


### Impact

Lack of `downsideProtected` update. This will cause cds owners cannot withdraw their funds.

### Mitigation

Revisit the `downsideProtected` update when borrowers withdraw their collateral. If there is not enough cds deposit amount in ChainA, we should consider to update the `downsideProtected` in the other chain.
