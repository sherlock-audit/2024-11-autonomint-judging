# Missing Oracle Price Staleness Checks in MasterPriceOracle

### Summary

The absence of staleness validation in price oracle data retrieval will cause a critical price manipulation vulnerability for borrowers and lenders as malicious actors can exploit stale prices.


### Root Cause

The price retrieval from both Chainlink and Redstone oracles at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83 lacks essential timestamp and validity checks:
```solidity
// Chainlink implementation
(, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();

// Redstone implementation
uint256 priceInUsd = oracle.priceOf(underlying);
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- Attacker monitors oracle feeds for potential staleness
- When oracle price becomes stale (e.g., Redstone/ Chainlink stops updating due to some issues)
- If true market price is lower than stale price:
Attacker takes out maximum possible loan using overvalued collateral
When oracle eventually updates, attacker's position becomes undercollateralized
- If true market price is higher than stale price:
Attacker can trigger unfair liquidations of other users' positions
Positions are liquidated based on low stale prices

Similarly, protocol/ users can incur losses even during normal operations due to stale prices/

### Impact

The protocol and its users suffer potential losses up to the total value of positions affected by incorrect pricing. Specific impacts include:

- Borrowers may face unfair liquidations
- Protocol may accept insufficient collateral for loans
