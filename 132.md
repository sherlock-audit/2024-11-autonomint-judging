# Replay attack vulnerability in `withdraw` function due to nonce mismanagement, in `CDS` contract

### Summary

The `withdraw` function in the `CDS` contract allows users to withdraw their deposits using a signed message. However, the function does not check if the `nonce` provided in the signed message has already been used. This omission enables attackers to reuse the same signed message, leading to a replay attack where they can withdraw funds repeatedly with old `excessProfitCumulativeValue` without offchain bot.

### Root Cause

- The `withdraw` function relies on a signature with a `nonce` to authorize the operation.

- There is no mechanism in place to track or invalidate already-used `nonce` values.  
- This allows the attacker to reuse a valid signature multiple times, exploiting the contract by repeatedly withdrawing funds.

### Impact

- **Double Withdrawal**: Users or attackers can replay a previously valid signature, causing unauthorized withdrawals.  
- **Financial Loss**: The protocol may suffer significant losses as funds are drained multiple times from the same account with old excess profit cumulative value.

### Mitigation

   ```solidity
   mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public usedNonces;

   function _verify(
       FunctionName functionName,
       uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
       uint256 nonce,
       bytes memory odosExecutionData,
       bytes memory signature
   ) private returns (bool) {
       if (usedNonces[msg.sender][nonce]) revert CDS_ReplayAttackDetected();
       usedNonces[msg.sender][nonce] = true;

       // Signature verification logic...
   }
   ```
