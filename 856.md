# the function updateDownsideProtected is not protected

### Summary

The function **updateDownsideProtected** is not protected, which means that anyone can call it and manipulate the variable **downsideProtected**. This can lead to various issues; for example, a malicious user could cause it to revert in any function that calls **_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount**. This function attempts to subtract **downsideProtected** from **totalCdsDepositedAmount**. If a user provides a large value for **downsideProtected** that exceeds **totalCdsDepositedAmount**, it will result in a revert. The variable **totalCdsDepositedAmount** is crucial, as it is used to calculate the cumulative rate and many other important calculations.   so since we can control  **totalCdsDepositedAmount**
with the function **_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount**  we can manipulate the cumulative variable
