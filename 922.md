# `liquidationType2` interacts with Synthethix incorrectly

### Summary

`liquidationType2` takes 50% of a liquidated user's collateral and transfers it to Synthethix. To do that it first must convert the collateral into WETH and after that the WETH to sETH. The issue is that WETH cannot be converted to sETH in a 1:1 ratio as there is a mint fee. Furthermore, the `liquidationType2` makes the incorrect assumption that the exact amount of WETH will be converted into sETH.

### Root Cause

In `liquidationType2` the same amount of WETH that is converted into sETH is attempted to be exchanged through Synthethix. The issue is that the actual amount of converted sETH will be lower than the amount of WETH. As a result, the liquidation will revert due to a lack of tokens.

Here we can see that when minting sETH with WETH there is a fee thus the `amount` of WETH will not be equal to the sETH received from the conversion:

### Attack Path

1. User gets liquidated through `liquidationType2`.
2. 1 ETH must be exchanged through Synthethix.
3. The 1 ETH is converted into WETH and the WETH is converted into sETH.
4. However, due to the fees only 0.995 sETH is received from the conversion.
5. Nevertheless, 1 ETH is attempted to be exchanged through Synthethix, however the call reverts as there is only 0.995 sETH available,

### Impact

Liquidaitons through `liquidationType2` will revert.

### Mitigation

Instead of exchanging `amount` get the amount of sETH received from the conversion and use that amount when exchanging through Synthethix.
