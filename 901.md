# Re-Entrancy Vulnerability in `Borrowing::redeemYields` Function Allowing ETH Drain from Treasury Contract

### Summary
The `Borrowing::redeemYields` function allows users to redeem their ABOND tokens for ETH yields from an external protocol. However, this function is vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks because it lacks a `nonReentrant` modifier and does not update the user's state prior to making an external call. As a result, an attacker can exploit the external call and re-enter the function, draining the ETH in the Treasury contract.

### Root Cause

Re-entrancy occurs for two primary reasons:  
1. The `nonReentrant` modifier is missing in the user-facing `Borrowing::redeemYields` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L318), and it is also absent in the external call made in the [Treasury contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L292) specifically the line `(bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");` within the `withdrawFromExternalProtocol` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L703). 
   
2. The user's state, specifically `userState.aBondBalance`, is not updated during the execution flow. As a result, the `withdrawFromExternalProtocol` function in the Treasury contract, which makes an arbitrary external call to transfer ETH, does not reduce the user's balance. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call `Borrowing::redeemYields`, draining ETH from the Treasury contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions
- The attacker must deploy a contract with a fallback function to exploit the re-entrancy vulnerability by invoking `Borrowing::redeemYields` when ETH is sent to it.
- The attacker must first deposit ETH in the `borrowing.sol` contract.
- Afterward, the attacker needs to withdraw from `borrowing.sol`, gaining ABOND tokens and the associated state `userState.aBondBalance`.

### External Pre-conditions
No additional external conditions are required, but the attack relies on the presence of a fallback function in the attacker’s contract to exploit the vulnerability.

### Attack Path

The attacker must deploy a contract that calls `Borrowing::redeemYields` within its fallback function when ETH is sent to it. The re-entrancy exploit follows the steps below:

1. Trigger `Borrowing::redeemYields` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L318).
2. Call `BorrowLib::redeemYields` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1029)
3. Execute the `Treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L290).
4. Call `withdrawFromIonicByUser` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L703).
5. Re-enter the `Borrowing::redeemYields` function through the external call `[bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L292).

The attacker can repeatedly call this flow without any reverts due to the absence of state updates and re-entrancy protection, draining ETH from the Treasury contract.

### Impact
The attacker can drain all ETH from the Treasury contract, resulting in a significant financial loss to the protocol. This would also prevent other users from redeeming their ETH yields, as the Treasury contract would be emptied by the attack.

### PoC


### Mitigation
1. Apply the `nonReentrant` modifier to the `Borrowing::redeemYields` function and the `Treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol` function to prevent re-entrancy attacks.
2. Update the user's state, specifically the `userState.aBondBalance`, before the external call is made in the `BorrowLib::redeemYields` function, specifically before the line `uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user, aBondAmount);`. This ensures that the user’s balance is correctly updated before any external calls are made.
