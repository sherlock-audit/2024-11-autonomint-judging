# Incorrect fee is passed as param of `_getDownsideFromCDS` in `_withdraw` function

### Summary

In `_withdraw` function of borrowing contract, `_getDownsideFromCDS` is called where 2nd parameter is `feeForOFT` and it is passed as (msg.value - nativeFee).
```solidity
if (result.downsideProtected > 0) {
                _getDownsideFromCDS(
                    result.downsideProtected,
@>                  msg.value - fee.nativeFee
                );
```
In `_getDownsideFromCDS` function, `feeForOFT` is used for `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains`:
```solidity
function _getDownsideFromCDS(
        uint128 downsideProtected,
        uint256 feeForOFT
    ) internal {
        if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
            // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
            globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{
@>              value: feeForOFT
            }
...
```
Because `feeForOFT` is passed as (msg.value - nativeFee) as param, it will be variable amount passed in the function. So that whatever user send as msg.value deducted by nativeFee will be the `feeForOFT` for `_getDownsideFromCDS` function. If it will be higher than what the fee should be then it will not be reverted back to user.

### Root Cause

`feeForOFT` is passed as (msg.value - nativeFee) param of `_getDownsideFromCDS` in `_withdraw` function which is wrong.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

`_getDownsideFromCDS` function's 2nd parameter `feeForOFT` is depend on the native eth user has sent as msg.value because it will be msg.value deducted by the nativeFee.

Therefore, if user send more native eth as msg.value, `feeForOFT` will be passed more and if it will be higher than actual fees then it will not be refunded back to user as well.

### Impact

`feeForOFT` of `_getDownsideFromCDS` function will be depend on native eth transferred by user as msg.value in withdraw function. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol should make sure that `feeForOFT` of `_getDownsideFromCDS` function is being passed correctly.
