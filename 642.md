# Missing Check for Withdrawn Positions in `liquidation` process

### Summary

The [`liqudiation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L363), [`liquidationType1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L174) and [`liquidationType2`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L324) functions fail to check if the position being liquidated has already been withdrawn. This oversight allows the entity responsible for liquidation to attempt liquidation on positions where the collateral has already been returned to the borrower, leading to invalid operations, potential reverts, or inconsistent protocol state.



### Root Cause

Both functions  do not verify if the position has been withdrawn, The `withdrawed `flag in `depositDetail` is not considered, allowing liquidation on positions where collateral has already been withdrawn.


### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
There's no guarantee that the liquidation process won't take withdrawn positions in consideration after the eth price drops.
Liquidation proceeds on positions where the collateral has already been withdrawn, leading to opening short positions on a collateral that was already withdrawn or in the case of `liquidationType1` this could lead to mismanage of funds of the treasury in favor of cds users who opted for liquidation gains.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the `liquidateBorrowPosition` add a check:
```javascript
require(!depositDetail.withdrawed, "Position already withdrawn");
```
