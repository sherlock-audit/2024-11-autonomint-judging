# User with 10 000+ health will pay significally more for upsides in case current eth value less then option strike price

### Summary

BorrowLib.sol : calculateCollateralToReturn() adjust amount of value to return in case current eth price higher then it was in time of deposit
```solidity
        uint128 depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice;
        uint128 collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        // If the health is greater than 1
        if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000) {
            // If the ethPrice is higher than deposit ethPrice,call withdrawOption in options contract
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
```
Issue arise because it's assumed that the user's option gains won't be 0 in case borrowing health more then 10 000
But by design in case current eth value less then strike price we won't add any additional amount to this adjusted collateral amount(mention, it is lower then initial amount in eth we deposited)

If user's initial collateral was erc20 eth-type token we expect to charge upsides from user (to adjust eth value to erc20-type eth) - by design since erc20 eth tokens commonly cost more we need to adjust our eth amount to erc20 eth amount

in Treasury.sol: withdraw()
```solidity
uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
            uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate; 
            // Transfer collateral to user
            bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
```

Main problem is that amount we subtract was adjusted down according current price, but wasn't increased by any gains, since strike price wasn't achieved. This leads to one-side adjustment and funds lose for user. As you can see, in this scenario user will receive same value of collateral like in case if eth price (price of collateral) fall in price



### Root Cause

BorrowLib.sol : calculateCollateralToReturn()
```solidity
        uint128 collateralToReturn;
        //Calculate current depositedAmount value
        uint128 depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice;
        uint128 collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        // If the health is greater than 1
        if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000) {
            // If the ethPrice is higher than deposit ethPrice,call withdrawOption in options contract
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
```
in Treasury.sol: withdraw()
```solidity
uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
            uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate; 
            // Transfer collateral to user
            bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1) eth price should be more then eth price while deposit and its current value should be less then strike price value

### Attack Path

1)User borrows
2)User withdrawing in time strike price wasn't reached
3)upsides being overcharged

### Impact

Loss of funds for user because upsides being calculated depends on one-side adjusted eth amount
