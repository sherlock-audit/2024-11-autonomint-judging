# The `borrowing.lastCumulateRate` update error will cause protocol loss.


### Summary

The incorrect update of `borrowing.lastCumulativeRate` will cause a reduction in borrower debt, leading to a loss for the protocol as the `borrowing.lastCumulateRate` is updated wrongly when withdrawal from borrowing.

### Root Cause

- In [`borrowing.sol#_withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L635-L714) function, `lastCumulativeRate` is updated after `lastEventTime` is updated.


```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        ......

        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
--->    lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
--->    calculateCumulativeRate();

        ......
    }
```

- In `borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()`, `lastCumulativeRate` is updated from `currentTime` and `lastEventTime`.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
--->    uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
--->        lastEventTime,     (Audit >> THIS IS SAME AS block.timestamp)
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `setFeeO` to set `fee` to be exactly `1 ETH`.
2. `lendingRate` to be other than `1.0`.
3. Number of ETH in `stake.sol` to go from `10 ETH` to `100 ETH` within 24 hours.

### External pre-conditions

1. ETH oracle needs to go from `4000` to `5000` within 2 minutes.
2. Gas price needs to be exactly `100 wei`.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `_withdraw()` function.
2. `lastEventTime` is updated before `calculateCumulativeRate()` is called.
3. `calculateCumulativeRate()` uses the updated `lastEventTime`, leading to incorrect `lastCumulativeRate`.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss due to the incorrect calculation of `lastCumulativeRate`, resulting in less debt for the borrower.

### Mitigation

The `borrowing.sol#_withdraw()` function has to be modified as follows:

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        .............

++      calculateCumulativeRate();
        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
--      calculateCumulativeRate();

        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositDetail.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
```
