# depositedAmountvalue calculation is incorrect in function calculateCollateralToReturn(BorrowLib.sol).

### Summary

when borrowing health is greater than 1, borrower gets back less collateral but when borrowing health is between 1 to 0.8 , borrower gets more collateral back(which is an unfair mechanism and this makes no sense). Also the  Calculation of  current depositedAmount value is incorrect. So collateralRemainingInWithdraw calculation will be incorrect. collateralRemainingInWithdraw may be accounted less than the expected. 


### Root Cause

depositedAmountvalue calculation is incorrect in function calculateCollateralToReturn(BorrowLib.sol).

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, the function withdraw(borrowlib.sol) is called by a user, the user’s depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit = 500 usd,depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH = 2 eth, params.ethPrice i.e current eth price = 600 usd, depositDetail.assetName = ETH. 

2. now in the withdraw function,calculateCollateralToReturn is called where current depositedAmount value is calculated in this way i.e depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice; i.e depositedAmountvalue = 2*500/600 = 1000/600 = 1.66 eth, as params.borrowingHealth > 10000 so collateralToReturn = 1.66+0.10(assume 0.10 strikegains) = 1.77 eth, collateralRemainingInWithdraw = 2-1.77 = 0.23 eth, so final  collateralToReturn =  calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) - collateralRemainingInWithdraw = 1-0.23 =0.77 eth.

3. when params.borrowingHealth == 10000, then collateralToReturn = depositedAmountvalue = 2*500/500 = 2 eth . so final  collateralToReturn = 1-0 = 1 eth.

4. when 8000 < params.borrowingHealth && params.borrowingHealth < 10000, collateralToReturn = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH = 2 eth, so final collateralToReturn = 1-0 = 1 eth.

5. so when borrowing health is greater than 1, borrower gets back less collateral but when borrowing health is between 1 to 0.8 , borrower gets more collateral back(which is an unfair mechanism and this makes no sense). Also the  Calculation of  current depositedAmount value is incorrect. The calculation should be like this i.e depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.ethPrice)/ params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, so now depositedAmountvalue = 2*600/500 = 1200/500 = 2.4 eth( where depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit = 500 usd,depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH = 2 eth, params.ethPrice i.e current eth price = 600 usd).

So collateralRemainingInWithdraw calculation will be incorrect. collateralRemainingInWithdraw may be accounted less than the expected.

### Mitigation

the calculation should be like this i.e depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.ethPrice)/ params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit,
