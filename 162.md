# Missing staleness check

### Summary

The `MasterPriceOracle::_price` function relies on the Chainlink oracle to fetch asset prices on the OP Mainnet. However, the implementation lacks a check for stale prices. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that there is no mechanism in place to check if the price fetched from the Chainlink oracle is stale. This is evident in the code section where the latest price is fetched without checking for its timestamp or last updated time.

### Impact
