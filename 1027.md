### Attack Path

- The main bug occurs because there is no validation to check the input provided by user to redeem USDT is in correct price ratio or not.
- redeemUSDT() is there for user who want to swap USDa to USDT.
- In the whole function there is no check that the input price provided by user during redeemUSDT() are correct and according to market price.
```solidity
 function redeemUSDT(
        uint128 usdaAmount,
        uint64 usdaPrice,
        uint64 usdtPrice
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(6)) {
        burnedUSDaInRedeem = CDSLib.redeemUSDT(
            Interfaces(
                treasury,
                globalVariables,
                usda,
                usdt,
                borrowing,
                CDSInterface(address(this))
            ),
            burnedUSDaInRedeem,
            usdaAmount,
            usdaPrice,
            usdtPrice
        );

        // getting options since,the src don't know the dst state
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);

        // calculting fee
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            IBorrowing.AssetName(0),
            _options,
            false
        );

        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            IBorrowing.AssetName(0),
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
```
- Because of this Attacker would provide malicious input during redeem such that he can claim all of the USDT as there is no validation for it.
`uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);`
- Attacker would repeat this process to claim USDT whenever the balance of USDT is greater than zero.

### Impact

- Attacker would drain whole USDT tokens from contract as there is no validation for the price they had inputted during redeemUSDT()

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There should be validation of input provided by user such that the input price provided should match the current market price.
