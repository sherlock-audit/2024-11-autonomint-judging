# `MasterPriceOracle` Lacks Proper Proxy Implementation

### Summary

The [`MasterPriceOracle.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L17) contract was intended to be deployed as a proxy but lacks the required inheritance from `UUPSUpgradeable`. This design flaw prevents the contract from functioning as a UUPS proxy, potentially leading to an inability to upgrade the contract and leaving the protocol in a non-upgradable state. This flaw can result in severe operational limitations and security risks for the protocol and its users.

### Root Cause

The contract does not inherit from `UUPSUpgradeable`, which is required for implementing a UUPS proxy. Additionally, the constructor is used for initialization, which is incompatible with proxy deployments.

```solidity
contract MasterPriceOracle is Initializable, BasePriceOracle { 
    constructor(address[] memory underlyings, address[] memory _oracles) {
        // Initialization logic here
    }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The development team deploys `MasterPriceOracle` with the intention of using it as a UUPS proxy.
2. The contractâ€™s constructor is used to initialize state variables instead of the `initializer` modifier, which is required for proxy patterns.

### External pre-conditions

1. A UUPS-compatible proxy contract is deployed to upgrade the `MasterPriceOracle`.
2. The protocol attempts to use upgrade functionality, which will fail due to the missing `UUPSUpgradeable` inheritance and initializer.

### Attack Path

1. The protocol deploys `MasterPriceOracle` assuming it is compatible with the UUPS proxy pattern.
2. At a later stage, the protocol attempts to upgrade the contract to add new functionality or fix vulnerabilities.
3. The upgrade fails due to the missing `UUPSUpgradeable` inheritance and proxy-compatible implementation, leaving the protocol locked into the current state of the contract.

### Impact

- **Operational Impact:** The protocol cannot upgrade the `MasterPriceOracle` contract, leaving it unable to adapt to new requirements or fix critical vulnerabilities.
- **Security Risks:** If vulnerabilities are discovered in the deployed contract, the inability to upgrade leaves the protocol exposed to attacks.
- **Reputational and Financial Damage:** Failure to implement proxy compatibility could undermine user confidence and result in financial losses due to stalled operations or security breaches.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this issue, the `MasterPriceOracle` contract must be updated to inherit from `UUPSUpgradeable` and use an initializer function for state variable initialization. The revised implementation should resemble the following:

```solidity
+ import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";
+ import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

- contract MasterPriceOracle is Initializable, BasePriceOracle {
+ contract MasterPriceOracle is Initializable, IBasePriceOracle, UUPSUpgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable {


-    constructor(
-        address[] memory underlyings,
-        address[] memory _oracles
-    ) {

+    function initialize(
+        address[] memory underlyings,
+        address[] memory _oracles
+    ) public initializer {

+        // Initialize the owner of the contract
+        __Ownable_init(msg.sender);
+        // Initialize the proxy
+        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

        // Get the total number of collateral addresses
        uint16 noOfUnderlyings = uint16(underlyings.length);

        // Check the number of pricefeed addresses and collateral addresses are same
        if (noOfUnderlyings != _oracles.length)
            revert Oracle_CollateralAddressesAndPriceFeedIdsMustBeSameLength();

        // Loop through the number of collateral address
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < noOfUnderlyings; i++) {
            // Assign the value(pricefeed address) for a key(collateral address)
            oracles[underlyings[i]] = _oracles[i];
            // Assign the value(collateral address) for a key(collateral name ENUM)
            assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName(i + 1)] = underlyings[i];
        }
    }




+    function _authorizeUpgrade(
+        address newImplementation
+    ) internal override onlyOwner{}

}
```

also better to rename the `BasePriceOracle` to `IBasePriceOracle`

`Blockchian\contracts\oracles\BasePriceOracle.sol` -> `Blockchian\contracts\oracles\IBasePriceOracle.sol`
