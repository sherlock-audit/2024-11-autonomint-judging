# omniChainData.cdsPoolValue is not decreased/updated in the  function liquidationType1,as a result cds/ borrow ratio will be bigger than expected.

### Summary

omniChainData.cdsPoolValue is not decreased/updated in the  function liquidationType1,as a result cds/ borrow ratio will be bigger than expected till all cds depositors(who opted for liquidation amount) don’t withdraw their deposited amount. So there may come a scenario when  the cds/borrow’s real  ratio may become below 0.2 but the protocol will calculate above 0.2(so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2).


### Root Cause

omniChainData.cdsPoolValue is not decreased/updated in the  function liquidationType1


### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, currently omniChainData.cdsPoolValue = 500,  omniChainData.vaultValue = 2000, so cds/borrow ratio = 500/2000 = 0.25

2. now the function liquidationType1 is called where 100 amount is liquidated, now omniChainData.vaultValue = 2000-100 = 1900(as 100 usd worth of collateral is allocated for cds depositer) and omniChainData.cdsPoolValue = 500-100 = 400(as 100 is liquidated). So the current cds/borrow ratio should be 400/1900 = 0.21.

3. but as omniChainData.cdsPoolValue is not decreased/updated in the  function liquidationType1,so omniChainData.cdsPoolValue is still 500 and cds/borrow ratio = 500/1900 = 0.26 which is bigger than real cds/borrow ratio.

4. cds/borrow ratio will be corrected when all cds depositors(who opted for liquidation amount) withdraw because after their withdrawals cdspoolvalue is decreased and cds/borrow ratio becomes correct.

5. cds/ borrow ratio will be bigger than expected till all cds depositors(who opted for liquidation amount) don’t withdraw their deposited amount. So there may come a scenario when  the cds/borrow’s real  ratio may become below 0.2 but the protocol will calculate above 0.2(so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2).

### Impact

cds/ borrow ratio will be bigger than expected till all cds depositors(who opted for liquidation amount) don’t withdraw their deposited amount. So there may come a scenario when  the cds/borrow’s real  ratio may become below 0.2 but the protocol will calculate above 0.2(so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2).

### Mitigation

update/decrease omniChainData.cdsPoolValue in the  function liquidationType1
