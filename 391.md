# Multiple problems during `liquidationType2`

### Summary

During `liquidationType2` first the ether is wrapped to WETH and then is minted sETH, and this sETH is exchanged to sUSD. But the problem is that the exchanged value that is returned is not exchanged and it's passed another value as margin. Another problem that occur here is that during `submitOffchainDelayedOrder` wrong value is passed due to not correct scale.

### Root Cause

Let's dive deep in both problems:
1. Instead of passing the return value of the exchange to the `transferMargin`, it is calculated using the amount and the ethPrice which will be not correct due to the fact, that syntetix exchange will most probably return a different value. And if the amount of the exchange > amount * ethPrice, the difference will be stucked.
2. Due to wrong scaling higher value will be passed and the code will revert most probably.

### Impact

In the current implementation this function will most probably revert due to the wrong scaling `submitOffchainDelayedOrder` and if the problem with the scaling is fixed, also the stucked funds problem should be fixed.

### Mitigation

Following fix:
```diff
+      uint256 amountRecevied = synthetix.exchange(
-       synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        ); 
        // here it should the return amount as margin

        // Calculate the margin
-       int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        // Transfer the margin to synthetix
+      synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(amountRecevied);
-       synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);

        // Submit an offchain delayed order in synthetix for short position with 1X leverage
        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
+            -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
-             -int((uint(margin * 1 ether) / currentEthPrice * 1e16))
              currentEthPrice * 1e16
        );
```
