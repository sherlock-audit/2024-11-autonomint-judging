# Incorrect Update of `calculateCumulativeRate` in `_withdraw` Results in Erroneous Interest Calculation

### Summary

In the Borrowing::_withdraw function, the calculateCumulativeRate method is invoked after the lastEventTime variable is updated to the current block.timestamp. 
Here's the relevant portion of the function:
```solidity
function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        ...
            lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);
        }

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
        calculateCumulativeRate();
        ...
    }
```
The calculateCumulativeRate function internally calls a method from BorrowLib and passes the lastEventTime—which was updated just before this call—as a parameter. 
Here's the code for calculateCumulativeRate:
```solidity
function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
In BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate, the currentCumulativeRate is calculated using the difference between the current block.timestamp and the lastEventTime. This difference is referred to as timeInterval.
However, since lastEventTime is updated to block.timestamp before the call to calculateCumulativeRate, the timeInterval becomes 0. This causes the interest to remain unchanged, as no meaningful time difference is accounted for in the calculations. This issue prevents the proper update of the cumulative rate and leaves it at its previous value.



### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The interest calculation relies on the `timeInterval`, which is the difference between the current time and `lastEventTime`. In the `_withdraw` function, `lastEventTime` is updated to `block.timestamp` before the interest is calculated, resulting in no actual update to the interest. 

As a result, each time the `_withdraw` function is called, the interest for the period (current time - `lastEventTime` before the function call) is not properly accounted for.

### Impact

The interest is not being updated correctly in the `_withdraw` function, causing the interest for that time interval to be missed for all users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should ensure that `calculateCumulativeRate` is updated before `lastEventTime` is set to `block.timestamp`, allowing the interest to be calculated accurately.
