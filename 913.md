# Centralisation Control Risk/ Design in the EIP712 implementation from the `CDS.sol` contract, Allowing an admin to choose centralised power that stops users from withdrawing thier own funds independently.

### Summary

The design of the the `withdraw` function in the `CDS.sol` contract is unusual and has a design flaw, i believe the intented Design was to allow all users calling the withdraw function in the `cds.sol` contract, go through a verification process that allow the `hashedAdminTwo` actor first verify that he is the signer. despite the the user that called the `deposit` function being the legitimate owner. This gives centralised power to the `hashedAdminTwo` actor and also it restrict the `withdraw` function to be called by only `hashedAdminTwo` actor which creates a centralisation risk and functionality distruction(only admin can withdraw).

### Root Cause

The root cause to this vulnerability is caused by the intended design, majorly in the `verify` function in the `CDS.sol` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

nil

### External pre-conditions

nil

### Attack Path

1. User deposits USDa by callong the `deposit` function.
2. When withdrawal period is reached, user attempts to withdraw.
3. User cannot generate valid admin signature.

### Impact

The Impact of the vulnerability is as follows:
1. Users cannot withdraw their own funds independently
2. All withdrawals must be approved by a specific admin (hashedAdminTwo)
3. If admin is unavailable or compromised, user funds are effectively locked
4. Admin has complete control over who can and cannot withdraw funds

### PoC

The check makes it impossible for regular users to withdraw function, even though the function checks msg.sender's deposit.
```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint64 index,
    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory signature
) external payable nonReentrant {
    
    if (!_verify(FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW, excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, "0x", signature)) 
        revert CDS_NotAnAdminTwo();
        
    
    if (cdsDetails[msg.sender].index < index) 
        revert CDS_InvalidIndex();
    ...
}
```

### Mitigation

The mitigations for this vulnerability is to redesign the `verify` function in the cds Contract to do a check that it allows the deposited user that calls the withdraw function to be the signer. 
- In this mitigation i verified the msg.sender instead of the admin2 actor.
```solidity
    function _verify(
    FunctionName functionName,
    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory odosExecutionData,
    bytes memory signature
) private view returns (bool) {
    bytes32 digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
        keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                keccak256(
                    "Permit(uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,uint256 nonce)"
                ),
                excessProfitCumulativeValue,
                nonce
            )
        )
    );
    
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
-            if (hashedSigner == hashedAdminTwo) 
+             if (signer == msg.sender) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
}
```
