# Calling BorrowLib.sol::renewOptions() will always revert

### Summary

```BorrowLib.sol::renewOptions()``` will always revert as most part of the code expects that the caller is the user, where we check if the caller has enough balance, until we get to ```calculateCumulativeRate()``` function invoked, which expects an ```onlyBorrowingContract``` address.

### Root Cause

We make a check if the caller has enough balance to pay the fee in `BorrowLib.sol::renewOptions()`. Code:
```solidity
// check whether the user has enough options fees to pay
if (interfaces.usda.balanceOf(msg.sender) < optionsFeesNeedsToPay) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InsufficientBalance();
```

Then, a few lines below we make a call to `calculateCumulativeRate()`:
```solidity
// updating last cumulative rate
omniChainData.lastCumulativeRate = interfaces.cds.calculateCumulativeRate(uint128(optionsFeesNeedsToPay));
```

 that should update the omniChainData but the call is made to a [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L666) that requires the address is the `onlyborrowingContract` modifier  which will always revert.
