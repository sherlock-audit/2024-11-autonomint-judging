# Underflow Vulnerability in `liquidationType1` Due to Debt Exceeding Collateral Amount

### Summary

There are two instances of underflow reverts in the `liquidationType1` function, caused by the same root issue. This occurs when the total amount of debt a borrower needs to repay, including interest, exceeds the collateral they originally deposited. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the unchecked growth of `borrowerDebt` over time, which can surpass the initial collateral deposited. This happens because the debt calculation, which uses a cumulative rate, is not capped at the amount of collateral the borrower deposited.

The debt is calculated as follows in the `borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1` function, where the borrower's total debt is computed with interest and assigned to `uint128 returnToTreasury`:

```solidity
uint256 borrowerDebt = ((depositDetail.normalizedAmount * lastCumulativeRate) / BorrowLib.RATE_PRECISION);
uint128 returnToTreasury = uint128(borrowerDebt);
```

If `returnToTreasury` exceeds the value of the collateral deposited at the time of the loan (i.e., `depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit`), it causes underflow reverts in the following two instances:

1. The first instance occurs in the calculation of [BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L209):

```solidity
uint128 returnToAbond = BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond(
    depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, returnToTreasury
);
```

This calculation fails due to the value of `returnToTreasury` being larger than `(((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100)`. When the subtraction happens in the [calculateReturnToAbond function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L143), it results in underflow:

```solidity
function calculateReturnToAbond(uint128 depositedAmount, uint128 depositEthPrice, uint128 returnToTreasury)
    public
    pure
    returns (uint128)
{
    return (((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;
}
```

2. The second instance of underflow revert happens in the calculation of [cdsProfits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L212):

Here, the value `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100` becomes smaller than `returnToTreasury` and `returnToAbond`. Therefore, subtracting them causes an underflow revert.

```solidity
uint128 cdsProfits = (
    ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury - returnToAbond;
```

### Internal Preconditions

This issue arises when the total debt to be repaid by the borrower (including interest) — represented by `returnToTreasury` — exceeds the collateral deposited at the time of borrowing.

### External Preconditions

None identified for this specific issue.

### Attack Path

- The borrower can exploit the scenario where their total debt exceeds the collateral. As a result, they cannot be liquidated since the liquidation process relies on these calculations.
- If this issue persists, the protocol may end up with unmanageable bad debt, as liquidation would not occur even with poor borrower health.

### Impact

- The protocol will be unable to perform the `liquidationType1` function, rendering it impossible to liquidate borrowers with significant bad debt. This could allow malicious borrowers to default without facing liquidation.
- This issue could lead to financial losses for the protocol and CDS participants, who benefit from liquidation events.
- It creates an unfair advantage for borrowers who manage to accumulate debt exceeding their collateral, knowing they will not be liquidated.

### Proof of Concept

h the following calculation that causes the underflow revert:

For example:
```solidity
(((1e18 * 1000e2) / 1e12) / 100) - 1200e6
```

Where the deposited amount at the time of loan equals `1000e6` and the accrued debt (`returnToTreasury`) equals `1200e6`. The result of this subtraction leads to underflow:

```solidity
((((1e18 * 1000e2) / 1e12) / 100) - 1200e6) * 10 / 100 => Underflow REVERT!
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, a mechanism should be implemented to ensure that liquidation occurs before the borrower's total debt exceeds their collateral amount. This could involve capping the growth of `borrowerDebt` relative to the deposited collateral or introducing safeguards to prevent liquidation from failing under such conditions.
