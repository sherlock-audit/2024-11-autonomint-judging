# Missing Whennotpaused modifer in the treasury.withdraw would lead to  unauthorized withdrawal of assets during critical situations when the protocol is paused.

### Summary

The missing `whennotpaused` modifier in the [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L226-L276) function in `Treasury.sol` would allow unauthorized withdrawal of assets when the protocol is paused.

### Root Cause

Unlike the [`withdDraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L281-L286) function in borrowing.sol which has a `whenNotPaused` modifier to prevent withdrawals when the protocol is paused, the [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L226-L232) function in the treasury contract doesn't implement this.

And this would lead to withdrawal of assets by users when protocol is paused.

### Impact

Allows unauthorized withdrawal of assets during critical situations when the protocol is paused.

### PoC

The withdraw function in the borrowing.sol contract has the `whenNotPaused` modifier
```solidity
    function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
        // check is _toAddress in not a zero address and isContract address
        if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);


        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer();
        // Get the depositor details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
        // Get the exchange rate for a collateral and eth price
        (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[getBorrowingResult.depositDetails.assetName]);


        // check if borrowerIndex in BorrowerDetails of the msg.sender is greater than or equal to Index
        if (getBorrowingResult.totalIndex >= index) {
            _withdraw(
                toAddress,
                index,
                odosAssembledData,
                uint64(ethPrice),
                exchangeRate,
                uint64(block.timestamp)
            );
        } else {
            // revert if user doens't have the perticular index
            revert Borrow_InvalidIndex();
        }
    }
```

The withdraw function in the treasury.sol contract has the `whnNotPaused` modifier missing 
```solidity

        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 index
    ) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (bool) {
        // Check the _amount is non zero
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw zero collateral");
        if (toAddress == address(0)) revert Treasury_ZeroAddress();
        // Get the borrower deposit details
        DepositDetails memory depositDetails = borrowing[borrower].depositDetails[index];
        // check the deposit alredy withdrew or not
        require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");


        // Update the collateral data
        depositedCollateralAmountInUsd[depositDetails.assetName] -= depositDetails.depositedAmountUsdValue;
        depositedCollateralAmountInWei[depositDetails.assetName] -= depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH;
        // Updating total volumes
        totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinUSD -= depositDetails.depositedAmountUsdValue;
        totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei -= depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH;
        // Deduct tototalBorrowedAmountt
        borrowing[borrower].totalBorrowedAmount -= depositDetails.borrowedAmount;
        borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH -= depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH;


        depositDetails.withdrawAmount += uint128(amount);
        // Based on collaterla type transfer the amounts
        if (depositDetails.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
            // Send the ETH to Borrower
            (bool sent, ) = payable(toAddress).call{value: amount}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Collateral");
        } else {
            uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
            uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate;
            // Transfer collateral to user
            bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
            // check the transfer is successfull or not
            require(sent, "Failed to send Collateral");
        }
        depositDetails.depositedAmount = 0;
        depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH = 0;


        // if user has no deposited collaterals then decrement number of borrowers
        if (borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0) {
            --noOfBorrowers;
        }
        borrowing[borrower].depositDetails[index] = depositDetails;
        // emit withdraw event
        emit Withdraw(toAddress, amount);
        return true;
    }
```


### Mitigation

Adding the whenNotPaused modifier to the withdraw function
