# Transferring ABONDToken to oneself will result in incorrect credit data.

### Summary

Transferring ABONDToken to oneself will result in incorrect credit data.

### Root Cause

```javascript
function transfer(
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        // check the input params are non zero
        require(msg.sender != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User");

        // get the sender and receiver state
        State memory fromState = userStates[msg.sender];
        State memory toState = userStates[to];

        // check sender has enough abond to transfer
        require(fromState.aBondBalance >= value, "Insufficient aBond balance");

        // update receiver state
        toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value));
@>        userStates[to] = toState;

        // update sender state
@>        fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
@>        userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;

        // transfer abond
        super.transfer(to, value);
        return true;
    }
```

```javascript
   function _debit(
        State memory _fromState,
        uint128 _amount
    ) internal pure returns(State memory) {

        uint128 balance = _fromState.aBondBalance;
        
        // check user has sufficient balance
        require(balance >= _amount,"InsufficientBalance");
 
        // update user abond balance
@>        _fromState.aBondBalance = balance - _amount;

        // after debit, if abond balance is zero, update cr and eth backed as 0
        if(_fromState.aBondBalance == 0){
            _fromState.cumulativeRate = 0;
            _fromState.ethBacked = 0;
        }
        return _fromState;
    }
```
It can be observed that when msg.sender is the same as the to address, userStates[msg.sender] will end up with incorrect data. Taking aBondBalance as an example, it should remain unchanged but will erroneously decrease.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This disrupts the normal functionality of the transfer() function, as transferring to oneself results in incorrect credit data.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a conditional check to ensure arithmetic operations are performed only when msg.sender is not equal to to.
