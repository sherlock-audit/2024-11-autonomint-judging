# Failure to Mark Collateral as Liquidated in `liquidationType2` Risks Repeated Liquidations

### Summary

The [`liquidationType2`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L324) function processes a liquidation but fails to update `depositDetail.liquidated` flag for the liquidated collateral unlike the [`liquidationType1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L174). This omission allows the same collateral to be liquidated multiple times, resulting in potential financial loss for the borrower and systemic inconsistencies in the protocol.




### Root Cause

The function includes a check to ensure the collateral has not already been liquidated:
```javascript
require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");
```
However, the liquidated flag is never set to true after processing the liquidation
```javascript
depositDetail.liquidated = true; // Missing
```
Without this update, the same collateral remains eligible for liquidation, leading to repeated liquidations on the same deposit.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A position can be liquidated multiple times through liquidationType2 or multiple times through `liquidationType2` and once through `liquidationType1`

### Impact
Even if the `liquidate` has an only admin modifier, usually the liquidation is done through an automatic bots, since there's no way to prevent a position to be liquidated multiple times, the likelihood of this scenario is high.
Same position could be liquidated multiple times meaning each liquidation would create a new short position creating a larger exposure than intended for the same initial collateral
 The protocol may incur losses by over-liquidating collateral and destabilizing its internal accounting.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set the liquidated flag to true after processing the liquidation:
```javascript
depositDetail.liquidated = true;
```
