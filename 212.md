# Replay Attacks Due to Improper Nonce Management in Signature Verification

### Summary

The `withdraw` function in the `CDS` contract requires a signature from `adminTwo` to authorize user withdrawals. The signature verification process is handled by the `_verify` function, which checks the signature against the `hashedAdminTwo`. However, there is a critical flaw in the nonce management within this process.

### Root Cause

 The contract does not store or track nonces used in the signature verification process. This omission allows an attacker to reuse a previously valid signature (replay attack) to authorize multiple withdrawals without `adminTwo`'s consent.

An attacker could intercept or obtain a valid signature from `adminTwo` and reuse it indefinitely to withdraw funds, leading to unauthorized fund transfers and potential loss of assets from the protocol.

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint64 index,
    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory signature
) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
    if (!_verify(FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW, excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, "0x", signature)) revert CDS_NotAnAdminTwo();
    // ... rest of the function
}
```


```solidity

    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory odosExecutionData,
    bytes memory signature

    if (functionName == FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW) {
        digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    keccak256(
                        "Permit(uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,uint256 nonce)"
                    ),
                    excessProfitCumulativeValue,
                    nonce
                )
            )
        );
    }
    // ... rest of the function

    address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
    bytes32 hashedSigner = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(signer));
    if (hashedSigner == hashedAdminTwo) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```




### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The attacker calls the `withdraw` function with the intercepted parameters.

  ```solidity
  cds.withdraw{value: msg.value}(index, excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, signature);
  ```

 The contract verifies the signature using the `_verify` function.

  - Since there is no nonce tracking, the signature is considered valid each time.

 The contract proceeds to process the withdrawal.

  - Funds are transferred to the attacker or credited to the attacker's account.

The attacker repeats Steps 1 to 3 multiple times.

### Impact

- **Unauthorized Withdrawals:** Attackers can perform unauthorized withdrawals by reusing old signatures, compromising the integrity of the protocol's fund management.

- **Loss of User Funds:** Users' deposited amounts are at risk due to potential unauthorized access.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement proper nonce management to prevent replay attacks. This involves:

1. **Storage of Nonces:** Maintain a mapping to track used nonces per user or globally.

    ```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) private _nonces;
    ```

2. **Nonce Verification and Increment:** Check if the nonce provided in the signature is equal to the expected nonce for the user, and increment it after successful verification.
