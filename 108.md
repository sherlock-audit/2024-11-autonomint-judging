# CumulativeValue calculation is wrong and can brick withdraws for dCDS depositors

### Summary
When calculating the amount in `USDa` to return to the `dCDS` depositor during withdrawal using `cdsAmountToReturn()`, a flaw occurs that causes a DoS or transaction revert if `cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit` does not equal `cumulativeValueSign`.

### Root Cause
The `cumulativeValue` fluctuates based on changes in the Ethereum price since the last interactions. To address this, the `lastEthPrice` is stored as a storage variable in the `CDS.sol` contract.

The issue arises in the calculation within `cdsAmountToReturn()` during a withdrawal, which can cause an underflow error, leading to a transaction revert.

We need to calculate the `currentValue` for the further logic:
```solidity
    function withdraw() external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
 ..............
        // Update user deposit data
        cdsDepositDetails.withdrawedTime = uint64(block.timestamp);
        cdsDepositDetails.ethPriceAtWithdraw = ethPrice;
@>>  uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn(
            msg.sender,
            index,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
            excessProfitCumulativeValue
        ) - 1;
```

However in the case where `cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit != cumulativeValueSign` and we enter the `else {` block there is a flaw, as the `depositedAmount - loss` could underflow pretty easily leading to revert of the transaction.
[CDS.sol#L486-L498](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L486-L498) 
```solidity
    function cdsAmountToReturn(address _user, uint64 index, uint128 cumulativeValue, bool cumulativeValueSign, uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue) private view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 depositedAmount = cdsDetails[_user].cdsAccountDetails[index].depositedAmount;
        uint128 cumulativeValueAtDeposit = cdsDetails[msg.sender].cdsAccountDetails[index].depositValue;
        // Get the cumulative value sign at the time of deposit
        bool cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit = cdsDetails[msg.sender].cdsAccountDetails[index].depositValueSign;
        uint128 valDiff;
        uint128 cumulativeValueAtWithdraw = cumulativeValue;

        // If the depositVal and cumulativeValue both are in same sign
        if (cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit == cumulativeValueSign) {
.........
        } else {
@>>         valDiff = cumulativeValueAtDeposit + cumulativeValueAtWithdraw;
            if (cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit) {
                // Its loss since cumulative val at deposit is positive
                uint256 loss = (depositedAmount * valDiff) / 1e11;
@>>             return (depositedAmount - loss);
            } else {
                // Its loss since cumulative val at deposit is negative
                uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;
                return (depositedAmount + profit);
            }
        }
    }
```
In order to enter in that case we just need `cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit` to be true + the lastETHPrice in the interaction s before that withdrawal to be a little higher than the current price, so we get `omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign` to equal false.
`uint256 loss = (depositedAmount * valDiff) / 1e11;` will be bigger than `depositedAmount`, as `valDiff > 1e11`

This will lead to underflow in the subtraction:  `return (depositedAmount - loss);`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
- dCDS depositors deposit when `cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit` is true
- dCDS depositor tries to withdraw when the current omnichain cumulativeValueSign is false. (this could happen for very small eth price changes )
- dCDS depositor transaction for withdrawal is bricked

### Impact
The issue causes bricking of `dCDS` withdrawals, as user attempts will revert if the Ethereum price has decreased slightly since the last interaction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Adjust the case where we handle loss to handle correctly the calculation and avoid underflow.
```solidity
         valDiff = cumulativeValueAtDeposit + cumulativeValueAtWithdraw;
            if (cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit) {
                // Its loss since cumulative val at deposit is positive
                uint256 loss = (depositedAmount * valDiff) / 1e11;
                return (depositedAmount - loss);
            } 
```
