# rsETH liquidations will screw up dCDS depositors as they reduce their USDa during withdraw but don't give them rsETH

### Summary
Depositor can directly deposit `rsETH` however if liquidation occurs it won't be accounted for in the dCDS logic, as we only use the `wrsETH` address in the dCDS withdraw logic.

### Root Cause
Borrowers can put up as collateral `rsETH`, however when withdrawing the  `rsETH` asset will be ignored when calculating shares, but will be deducted from the USDA amount to return, which effectively results in a loss of funds for dCDS depositors.

            if (
                params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations >=

            ) {
                // Loop through the liquidations that were done after user enters
                for (uint128 i = (liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1); i <= params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations; i++) {
                    uint128 liquidationAmount = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
                    // If the user available liquidation is non zero
                    if (liquidationAmount > 0) {
                        CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationData = omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo[i];
                        // Calculate the share by taking ratio between
                        // User's available liquidation amount and total available liquidation amount
                        uint128 share = (liquidationAmount * 1e10) / uint128(liquidationData.availableLiquidationAmount);
                        // Update users available liquidation amount
@>>                     params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount -= getUserShare(liquidationData.liquidationAmount, share);
                        // Based on the collateral type calculate the liquidated collateral to give to user
                        if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
                            // increment eth amount
                            params.ethAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
                        } else if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH) {
                            // increment weeth amount and weth amount value
                            weETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
                            weETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
                        } else if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH) {
                            // increment rseth amount and rseth amount value
                            rsETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
                            rsETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
                        }
                    }
                }
```

Since we reduce the `params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount -= getUserShare(liquidationData.liquidationAmount, share);`, but don't calculate shares as we don't have an if-else case for 
`liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH` 

The dCDS user's available liquidation amount will decrease, which is later accounted for the amount to be returned in USDa. Meaning they will get less USDa and no rsETH compensation

```solidity
   function withdrawUser() storage omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
......
@>>       uint256 returnAmountWithGains = params.returnAmount + params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;

       //returnAmountWithGains is basically returnAmount - liquidationAmount.
       returnAmountWithGains -= params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount;

......
@>>    params.usdaToTransfer = calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, returnAmountWithGains);
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
- User John deposits into the dCDS vault and opts in for liquidation gains.
- Borrower which deposited `rsETH` gets liquidated.
- John withdraws its deposit, however, he gets impacted by losses as he doesn't receive the rsETH that is owed to him.

### Impact
Loss of funds for the dCDS depositor, as his `USDa` gets reduced, but he doesn't get the liquidation amount in terms of `rsETH`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Handle the rsETH case appropriately when withdrawing the dCDs position.
