# Borrowers will enjoy the downside protection in `borrowing::withDraw` even after their position's options maturity expires.

### Summary

Borrowers will enjoy the downside protection in borrowing::withDraw even after their position's options maturity expires. They should only get downside protection when there option renew date is inside maturity, from when they are withdrawing.

### Root Cause

No check implementation is done for checking if the borrower's `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` time comes under maturity time from the current time (block.timestamp) Even if the borrower has not even renewed options for more than 30 days maturity time then also he will get downside protection from the protocol, and that's the ISSUE as the protocol will have to take loss because user will pay back the protocol less debt amount than intended.

```solidity
            uint128 downsideProtected = calculateDownsideProtected(
                depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, params.ethPrice, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit
            );
```

[Next](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L840) Total Debt Amount to pay back is getting subtracted with that calculated downside protection amount, and user is paying less than indended to protocol. Ultimatly here Protocol will suffer.

```solidity
depositDetail.totalDebtAmountPaid = borrowerDebt - downsideProtected;
``` 

### Internal pre-conditions

Downside protection is calculated to a positive number when the provided asset in eth price at the time of deposit was more than the price of current eth price. ie. when the collateral price is fallen below.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- borrower takes debt (deposit)
- borrower doesn't repay for a year, and do not even renew his option ever.
- After a year he withdraw(repay the debt) and still enjoys the benefit of downside protection by paying less debt to protocol than intended, due to lack of check(as shown in root cause)

### Impact

This will lead to unintended benefits for borrowers and financial losses for the protocol, because as explained in the above sections borrowers will
enjoys the benefits of downside protection whenever he repays his debt(no restriction of renew option time maturity) by paying less debt to protocol 
than intended, due to lack of check(as shown in root cause)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Provide downside protection to only those borrowers who are in renew options `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` maturity, implement this if check.
