# Critical Reentrancy Vulnerability in Yield Redemption Mechanism in Borrowing::redeemYields

### Summary

A severe security vulnerability has been identified in the `Borrowing::redeemYields` function that allows users to convert their ABOND tokens into ETH yields. The implementation lacks crucial reentrancy protection and fails to update user states before executing external calls, making it susceptible to reentrancy attacks.


### Root Cause

Two main reasons re-entrancy is happening: 
1. `nonReentrant` modifier is missing in user calling function [Borrowing::redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L318)
and `nonReentrant` modifier is also missing on the external calling [(bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L292) function from where the re-entrancy will happen [Treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L703)
2.  [State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L990), ie. the state of the user's ABOND tokens is NOT at all updated in whole function flow, and therefore in treasury function `withdrawFromExternalProtocol` due this arbitrary external call `(bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");`  Attacker can re-enter the same  `Borrowing::redeemYields` , which will ultimately drain the ETH in Treasury contract.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- Malicious actor must deploy a contract with reentrancy capabilities in its fallback function
- Initial ETH deposit into borrowing.sol is required
- Attacker needs to acquire ABOND tokens through withdrawal process
- Target address must be different from contract address to prevent reverts

### Attack Path

The reentrancy exploitation follows this path:

1.  [Borrowing::redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L318) -> 
2. [BorrowLib::redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1029) -> 
3. [treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L290) -> 
4. [withdrawFromIonicByUser](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L703)
5. And then re-enter in `Borrowing::redeemYields` functions again from this external call -> [(bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L292)

### Impact

This vulnerability poses a critical risk as it enables malicious actors to repeatedly drain ETH from the Treasury contract, potentially depleting all available funds and preventing legitimate users from claiming their yields.


### PoC

Clearly explained in Attack Path. 


### Mitigation

1. Implement `nonReentrant` modifier on both `Borrowing::redeemYields` and `Treasury::withdrawFromExternalProtocol`
2. Ensure user state updates occur before any external calls, specifically updating `userState.aBondBalance` before executing `treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol`
