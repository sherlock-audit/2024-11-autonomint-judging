# There isn't any force for users to call `Borrowing::renewOptions`

### Summary
There isn't any force for users to call `Borrowing::renewOptions`

### Root Cause

one of important keys which has effect on CDS depositors is optionFees and users should call `Borrowing::renewOptions` periodically and when `Borrowing::renewOptions`  will be called then lastCumulativeRate will be updated accordingly

### PoC

users should call `Borrowing::renewOptions` 15 days after depositTime and they cannot call `Borrowing::renewOptions` 30 days after deposit time 
and also `Borrowing::renewOptions` which in turn calls `CDS::calculateCumulativeRate` which is very important for compute CDS's depositor's profit but there isn't any mechanism to force users for call that and this causes loss of funds for CDS depositors

### Impact
loss of funds for deposits

### Mitigation
consider to call `Borrowing::renewOptions` in `Borrowing::withDraw`
