# `downsideProtected` is incorrectly implemented

### Summary

`downideProtected` protects borrowers' collateral when the price of ETH drops. The issue is that it is currently implemented incorrectly as it is both burned from the borrower withdrawing their collateral and also burned from the Treasury. This is extremely problematic as the borrower should not also have to pay the downside.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.withdraw:870 the debt burned from the borrow is:

```solidity
uint256 burnValue = depositDetail.borrowedAmount - discountedCollateral;
```
The issue is that `downsideProtected` should also be deducted from `borrowedAmount`, as it is later burned from the treasury in borrowing._withdraw:

Furthermore, `depositDetail.totalDebtAmountPaid` is correctly set to `borrowerDebt - downsideProtected`, thus indicating that the borrower should not have to pay for the `downsideProtected`.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits into borrowing.sol.
2. After some time their collateral losses value and they have a positive `downsideProtected`.
3. Upon withdrawal, instead of the downside being taken away from the Treasury, the withdrawer also has to pay it.

### Impact

Borrowers are charged more debt than they should.

### Mitigation

`downsideProtected` should not be included in `burnValue`.
