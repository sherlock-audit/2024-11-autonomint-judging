# User won't get liquidated if the borrowed amount + interest on the borrowed amount gets higher than the collateral

### Summary

Users can currently get liquidated only in one scenario - when the price of the ETH they've deposited at the time of deposit goes below 80% of the current ETH price.

But the issue is that the protocol doesn't take into account the scenario in which the borrowed usdA, which will be 80% alongside the interest can get more than the deposited collateral depending on the interest rate, thus disincentivizing users to repay the loan.

### Root Cause

The root cause is a lack of mechanism that tracks borrowed amount + the interest accrued on that borrowed amount.

Currently, a loan can get only liquidated if the price at deposit is <80% of the current price of ETH.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User borrows usdA via `borrowing::depositTokens()`
2. Time passes and usdA + interest accrued on it becomes higher than the ETH deposited
3. Admin can't actually liquidate the position due to the current logic of liquidation

### Impact

After a time passes, users will find it cheaper to not repay the loan, thus causing a loss of interest to the lenders.

### Mitigation

Liquidate if the price of usdA + the interest goes above a certain threshold.
