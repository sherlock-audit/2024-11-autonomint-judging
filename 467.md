# cdsProfitsForOtherChain will be stuck in this chain’s treasury contract as liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain is transferred to this chain  with cdsProfitsForOtherChain.

### Summary

when the function liquidationType1 is called, liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain is transferred to this chain  with cdsProfitsForOtherChain. As a result,  cdsProfitsForOtherChain will be stuck in this chain’s treasury contract, as those cdsProfitsForOtherChain  is out of the accounting mechanism in this chain. So liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain should be  transferred to this chain  without cdsProfitsForOtherChain.


### Root Cause

when the function liquidationType1 is called, liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain is transferred to this chain  with cdsProfitsForOtherChain

### Attack Path

1. Liquidate function is called which calls the  function liquidationType1 where let’s assume, borrowerDebt = 89, so returnToTreasury = 89, returnToAbond = 1(this is just for example), cdsProfits = 10(this is just for example), liquidationAmountNeeded = returnToTreasury + returnToAbond = 89+1 = 90. liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain(with cds profit) = 45(this is just for example), cdsAmountToGetFromthisChain(with cds profit) = 45(this is just for example), so cdsProfitsForOtherChain = 5 and cdsProfitsForthisChain = 5,

2. let’s assume,  omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount = 1000, omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees = 1050, totalCdsDepositedAmount(for this chain) = 300,totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees(for this chain) = 315.

3. liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain(without cds profit) = 45-5 = 40, cdsAmountToGetFromthisChain(without cds profit) = 45-5 = 40, now omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount will be 1000-(90-10) = 920(as cds profit is also deducted) and totalCdsDepositedAmount(for this chain) will be 300-40 = 260(as cds profit for this chain is also deducted)

4. now as liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain(without cds profit) > 0 i.e 45>10, so 45 cds amounts will be transferred from other chains to this chain.let’s assume, the borrower depositdetails.depositamount = 85,interest = 4, returntoabond = 1, so 85 is burned from treasury in this chain, 4 is added to interest accounting, 1 is added to abondpool accounting.

5. so for liquidationAmountNeeded = 90, this chain’s cds amount contribution is 40(45-5 = 40, as 5 is cds profit for this chain) and liquidation amount/cds amounts contribution from other chains = 40(45-5 = 40, as 5 is cds profit for other chains) .

6. so 45-5 = 40 (without cds profit ) cds amount should be transferred from other chains to this chain. But as 45 cds amount is transferred to this chain , so 5 cds amount will be stuck in the chain’s treasury contract, as those 5 is out of accounting mechanism in this chain i.e before totalCdsDepositedAmount(for this chain) = 300 and now totalCdsDepositedAmount(for this chain) = 300-40 = 260.

### Impact

cdsProfitsForOtherChain will be stuck in this chain’s treasury contract, as those cdsProfitsForOtherChain  is out of the accounting mechanism in this chain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain should be  transferred to this chain  without cdsProfitsForOtherChain.
