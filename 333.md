# Missing Time Expiration Factor in Option Price Calculation Leading to Mispriced Options in `Options.sol::calculateOptionPrice()`

## Vulnerability Details
The option pricing function fails to account for time to expiration (theta decay) in its calculations, which is a fundamental component of option pricing. Options naturally lose value over time, and this time decay accelerates as the option approaches expiration. Without this factor, options will be incorrectly priced regardless of their time to expiration.

## Impact
The absence of time decay in option pricing leads to significant mispricing of options, causing direct financial impact to both users and the protocol. Near-expiry options are overpriced while longer-dated options might be underpriced, creating arbitrage opportunities and potential losses. For example, an option with 1 day to expiry would be priced the same as an identical option with 30 days to expiry, despite having vastly different time values.

## PoC:
Option A:
Strike: $2000
Current ETH: $2000
Volatility: 80%
Time: 30 days
Expected Premium: ~$250

Option B:
Strike: $2000
Current ETH: $2000
Volatility: 80%
Time: 1 day
Expected Premium: ~$50

Current implementation:
Both return same premium, ignoring time value

## Recommendation:

- Add time to expiration as a parameter
- Implement proper time decay calculations
- Add expiration tracking for options
- Implement time-based premium adjustments
