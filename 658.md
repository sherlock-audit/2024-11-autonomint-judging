# Lack of modifier on updateDownsideProtected

### Summary

The ``updateDownsideProtected`` function in the ``CDS.sol`` contract lacks appropriate access control, allowing any user to manipulate the ``downsideProtected`` variable. This vulnerability can be exploited to disrupt core functionalities of the protocol, resulting in DOS (Denial of Service) and mismanagement of user funds.

### Root Cause

The absence of access control in the ``updateDownsideProtected`` function enables unauthorized users to set arbitrary values for ``downsideProtected``. This leads to:

- **Underflow Risks**: Core functions that rely on ``downsideProtected`` are susceptible to underflow, causing reverts in their execution.
- **DOS Vulnerability**: Critical operations within the protocol, such as withdrawal and loan repayment, can be bricked if ``downsideProtected`` is set to extreme values (e.g., ``type(uint256).max``).

### Internal pre-conditions

- The ``downsideProtected`` variable in ``CDS.sol`` is unprotected and modifiable by any external user.
- Functions within the ``CDS.sol`` and dependent contracts (``Borrowing.sol``, ``BorrowLib.sol``) rely on ``downsideProtected`` for calculations.


### External pre-conditions

A malicious actor identifies the lack of access control in the ``updateDownsideProtected`` function and calls it with a large value.


### Attack Path

- **Unauthorized Manipulation**:
A malicious user calls ``updateDownsideProtected`` with a large value, such as ``type(uint256).max``.

```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```
- **Underflow in Core Functions**:
The inflated value of ``downsideProtected`` causes an underflow in the following functions:

``getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()``
```solidity
return totalCdsDepositedAmount - downsideProtected;
```
``getTotalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees()``
```solidity
return totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees - downsideProtected;
```
- **Reverts in Dependent Functions**:
These view functions are used in multiple dependent contract functions, including:

1. **BorrowLib.sol::calculateCumulativeRate**
Calls to ``getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()`` and ``getTotalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees()`` result in reverts due to underflow.

2. **BorrowLib.sol::renewOptions**
The call to ``cds.calculateCumulativeRate()`` bricks the function, disrupting protocol operations.

3. **Borrowing.sol::withdraw**
The ``_getDownsideFromCDS`` function uses ``getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()``, which reverts due to the manipulated value of ``downsideProtected``.

- **Permanent DOS and Fund Mismanagement**:

If ``downsideProtected`` is set to a high value, withdrawals and loan repayments are permanently bricked.
A malicious actor can set ``downsideProtected`` to reduce their loan repayment obligation unfairly.


### Impact

- **DOS Vulnerability**: Critical operations within the protocol are permanently bricked, rendering the protocol unusable.
- **Fund Mismanagement**: Arbitrary manipulation of ``downsideProtected`` leads to incorrect calculations, potentially causing insolvency.
- **High Severity**: This issue affects core functionality and can result in permanent loss of funds and reputation damage for the protocol.

```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```

### Mitigation

Restrict access to ``updateDownsideProtected`` to only trusted contracts
