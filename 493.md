# The `borrowing.sol#withDraw` will cause a DOS for users.


### Summary

Less hardcoded gas amount than tested will cause a DOS for users as the `borrowing.sol#withDraw` will fail due to insufficient gas.

### Root Cause

- In [`borrowing.sol#L676`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L676), less hardcoded value than tested is passed.

```solidity
        // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(350000, 0);
```

As we can see from the comment and other parts of the protocol, `350000` is less than tested.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `setGasOption` to set `gas` to be exactly `350000`.

### External pre-conditions

1. Gas price needs to be exactly `100 wei`.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `withDraw` function with the current gas setting.
2. The function fails due to insufficient gas, causing a DOS.

### Impact

The users suffer a denial of service due to insufficient gas allocation.

### Mitigation

`borrowing.sol:L676` has to be modified as follows.

```solidity
        // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
--      bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(350000, 0);
++      bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);
```
