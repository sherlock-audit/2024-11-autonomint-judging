# Potential Exploit: Unauthorized Withdrawal of USDT Tokens from `Treasury` Contract

### Summary

The `redeemUSDT` function of the `CDS` contract lacks validation for`usdaPrice`and`usdtPrice`. As a result, an attacker could potentially withdraw an arbitrary amount of USDT tokens.

### Root Cause

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506)
The `redeemUSDT` function does not perform any validation checks on `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice`. The `usdtAmount` is calculated using the following formula:
```solidty
    uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker acquires USDa tokens by calling the `withdraw` function of the `CDS` contract.
2. The attacker then calls the `redeemUSDT` function of the `CDS` contract, providing a high `usdaPrice` and a low `usdtPrice`. The greater the ratio of `usdaPrice` to`usdtPrice  , the more USDT tokens the attacker can redeem.

### Impact
The Treasury contract lost all of its USDT tokens. 
This protocol lost all of its USDT tokens because the Treasury contract serves as the treasury for this protocol.
### PoC

### Mitigation

The protocol should implement validation checks for both `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` to prevent unauthorized withdrawals of USDT tokens.
