# [H-2] Wrong `MasterPriceOracle` logic allows users to mint more `USDA` tokens when depositing

### Summary

The internal `_price` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L53) inside the `MasterPriceOracle` contract should return two things:

1. The exchange rate of the collaterals being deposited in ETH, represented with 18 decimals precision.
2. The value of `ETH` in `USD` with 2 decimals precision.

In VERY SHORT, the issue is that the `Borrowing::getUSDValue` function that calls `oracle.price` under the hood will return the actual price of the asset instead of the `exchangeRate` of the asset when users deposit non-native assets on the Optimism chain. The logic works as expected for Hardhat's local development and Mode network, but it erroneously returns the actual price of the asset for Optimism, which will lead to minting inflated amounts of USDA to users during deposits.

The issue explained -- Long version --

Depending on the chains that we're on, the logic is different. As we know, the protocol is supposed to be deployed on the [Mode network](https://chainlist.org/chain/34443) that has `block.chainid == 34443` and Optimism where `block.chainid == 10`. Also, if `block.chainid == 31337` (this is Hardhat's local development chain) the logic will be exactly the same as for Mode's chain.

Have a look at the code below.

```javascript
    function _price(address underlying) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
        // if there is no oracles found revert
        if (oracles[underlying] == address(0)) revert("Price oracle not found for this underlying token address.");

        // get oracles based on chain
        if (block.chainid == 31337 || block.chainid == 34443) {
//..
//..
            // get the price of the underlying
            uint256 priceInUsd = oracle.priceOf(underlying);
            // get the eth price
            uint256 priceOfNativeInUsd = oracle.priceOfETH();
            // return the exchange rate of the underlying to the ETH and eth price
            return (uint128((priceInUsd * 1e18) / priceOfNativeInUsd), uint128(priceOfNativeInUsd / 1e16));

//..
//..
```

When it comes to local development and Mode's network, we can see above that the function returns an `exchangeRate` between the price of the asset and ETH.

For example, let's assume that a user deposits `WrsETH` and the current price of this asset is 3300$, and native `ETH` is 3000$.
In this example, the `exchangeRate` would be `3300 * 1e18/ 3000e18` => 1.1 exchangeRate meaning that `1 WrsETH deposited == 1.1 ETH`.

In this case the `Borrowing::getUSDValue` function call will return `exchangeRate = 1.1e17` and `ethPrice = 3000.00` meaning $3000 with two decimal places.

These values are passed by the `Borrowing::depositTokens` to `BorrowingLib::deposit` function and will be used when computing the amount of `USDA` tokens that the user must get minted in return for their deposit.

**This is the intended design of the protocol and this is how the code should work.**

I'll stop here for a second to present the other 2 possibilities

```javascript
        } else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                //@audit this doesn't return an exchangeRate it returns the price of the asset directly
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
            return (0, 0);
        }
    }
```

If we are on Optimism chain, the Oracle will get the price of the asset `(, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();` and if the asset is native ETH, it will return `exchangeRate = 1 ether` and `ethPrice = price_/1e6`.

Maintaining the numbers from earlier this means that we have a 1:1 exchangeRate and a price of $3000.00 with two decimals.
In this scenario, the code will work as expected again because we have a 1:1 ratio and a valid price.

The issue arises in scenario nr. 3, when depositing non-native assets on the Optimism chain.
If you look at the code above if `underlying != native ETH` then we will reach this branch of the code.

```javascript
else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                //@audit this doesn't return an exchangeRate it returns the actual price of the asset directly
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
```

In here what happens is the function does a recursive call to itself, passing in `underlying == AssetName.ETH` in order to get `ethPrice` but then it doesn't calculate an actual exchange ratio between the asset that gets deposited and ETH, it just returns the price of the asset itself `price_`.

In this case, maintaining the numbers from before, the return values of the `Borrowing::getUSDValue` function will be `exchangeRate = 3.3e17` (this is the price of the asset that will be interpreted as an exchange rate by the protocol) instead of `1.1e17` as it should've been and `ethPrice = 300000` or $3000 with two decimals. The protocol believes that the underlying asset trades at a 3.3:1 tokens in this case.

Looking inside `BorrowingLib::deposit` function, `exchangeRate` is used when computing the depositingAmount
`params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;`

Because the Oracle returned the actual price of the asset instead of an exchange rate, the exchangeRate will be ~3 times bigger than what it should be, leading to a 3X bigger amount of `USDA` minted to the users.


### Root Cause

Wrong return value by `MasterPriceOracle::price` function when the assets being deposited is non-native ETH on the Optimism blockchain.

```javascript
    function _price(address underlying) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
 //..
//..
            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                //@audit this doesn't seem to return an exchange rate when the asset is not native ETH. It seems that it will return
                //the actual price of the asset instead, not an exchange rate.
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
            return (0, 0);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

A user calls `Borrowing::depositTokens` function attempting to deposit `wrsETH` to mint `USDA` on the Optimism chain.

### Impact

- Loss of funds for the protocol. The protocol erroneously inflates the actual amount deposited by the user and mints more `USDA` than intended.
- Users receive ~3 times more `USDA` than intended.

### PoC

The test will require two phases. In the first phase, the test deposits `wrsETH` into the protocol and checks how much `USDA` the user gets minted. Since we are on the local development chain, this will use the correct logic to compute the `exchangeRate` and `ethPrice`.

Add the following test into `BorrowingTest.ts` file

```javascript
    it.only("PoC: Demonstrates deposit miscalculation for wrsETH on chainid == 10", async function () {
      const {
        BorrowingContractA,
        CDSContractA,
        usdtA,
        globalVariablesA,
        TokenA, // The USDA token
        wrsETHA, // The wrsETH token
        user1,
        user2,
      } = await loadFixture(deployer);

      //mint USDT and deposit it into the CDS
      await usdtA.connect(user1).mint(user1.getAddress(), 20000000000);
      await usdtA.connect(user1).approve(CDSContractA.getAddress(), 20000000000);
      const options = Options.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0).toHex().toString();

      let nativeFee = 0;
      [nativeFee] = await globalVariablesA.quote(1, 1, options, false);
      await CDSContractA.connect(user1).deposit(10000000000, 0, true, 10000000000, 100000, {
        value: nativeFee.toString(),
      });

      //get the price of `wrsETH` from the Oracle
      const wrsETHpriceBefore = await BorrowingContractA.getUSDValue(await wrsETHA.getAddress());
      console.log("wrsETH price before deposit is:", wrsETHpriceBefore);

      //check user's USDA balance before deposit
      const usdaBalanceOfUserBefore = await TokenA.balanceOf(user2.getAddress());
      console.log("User USDA balance before deposit:", usdaBalanceOfUserBefore);

      // Approve wrsETH for deposit
      await wrsETHA.connect(user2).mint(user2.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("10")); // user2 has 10 wrsETH
      await wrsETHA.connect(user2).approve(BorrowingContractA.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("0.5"));

      //set deposit params -> 3 stands for AssetName.wrsETH
      const depositParamArray = [1, 110000, ethVolatility, 3, ethers.parseEther("0.5")];

      // Actually deposit tokens
      await BorrowingContractA.connect(user2).depositTokens(100000, await time.latest(), depositParamArray, {
        value: BigInt(nativeFee),
      });

      // Check how many USDA minted after deposit
      let usdaBalanceOfUserAfter = await TokenA.balanceOf(user2.getAddress());
      console.log("User USDA balance after deposit:", usdaBalanceOfUserAfter);

      const mintedInHumanReadable = Number(usdaBalanceOfUserAfter) / 1e6;
      console.log("Net minted USDA for depositing 0.5 wrsETH:", mintedInHumanReadable);
    });
```

Test output

```javascript
wrsETH price before deposit is: Result(2) [ 1030902658274509916n, 330424n ]
User USDA balance before deposit: 0n
User USDA balance after deposit: 373187082n
Net minted USDA for depositing 0.5 wrsETH: 373.187082
  ✔ PoC: Demonstrates deposit miscalculation for wrsETH on chainid == 10 (29351ms)

  1 passing (29s)
```

As you can see above the `exchangeRate` is `1030902658274509916n` or 1.03.... ETH for 1 `wrsETH` while the price of ETH is 330424n or $3304.24. The user deposited `0.5 wrsETH` and the amount of `USDA` that the user received is 373187082n or $373.187082 because USDA has 6 decimals.

Now go inside the `MasterPriceOracle.sol` file and comment out the current `_price` function and add this new `_price` function instead

```javascript
    function _price(address underlying) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
        // if there is no oracles found revert
        if (oracles[underlying] == address(0)) revert("Price oracle not found for this underlying token address.");

        // Get the eth price
        int256 price_ = 3300000000000000000;

        uint128 ethPrice = 300000;
        // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
        //the actual price of the asset instead, not an exchange rate.
        return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
    }
```

What the code above does is to hardcode the return values of the Oracle. The values mimic the example in scenario nr. 3 that I talked about earlier. The price of `wrsETH` is set to `3300000000000000000` or $3300 with 18 decimal places and ethPrice is `300000` or $3000 with two decimal places. If you replace these two values with the `exchangeRate = 1030902658274509916n` and `ethPrice = 330424n ` from the output of the previous test, this dummy oracle will return the same value. This is to double-check that it works as expected.

My updated Oracle returns the price of `wrsETH` directly because that's what the Oracle does when users deposit non-native assets on Optimism chain. There is no ratio calculated, the `exchangeRate` is the actual price of the asset.

Now rerun the same test and check the differences.

New test output
```javascript
wrsETH price before deposit is: Result(2) [ 3300000000000000000n, 300000n ]
User USDA balance before deposit: 0n
User USDA balance after deposit: 1194002440n
Net minted USDA for depositing 0.5 wrsETH: 1194.00244
  ✔ PoC: Demonstrates deposit miscalculation for wrsETH on chainid == 10 (28091ms)

  1 passing (28s)
```

As you can see, for exactly the same amount deposited (0.5 wrsETH) the user now got 1194002440n USDA or $1194.00244 minted, which is 3x more than what they should've gotten.

### Mitigation

Update the logic inside the `MasterPriceOracle::_price` function to properly calculate the `exchangeRate` when users deposit non-native assets on the Optimism blockchain.

Below is some idea, it may not be perfect, but it is a pointer. Since `ethPrice` will only have two decimals, I multiplied it by 1e16 so that `ratio` will have `1e18` accuracy as intended.

```diff
    function _price(address underlying) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
//..
//..
            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
//@we multiply ethPrice by 1e16 because the return value has two decimals only
+               uint256 ratio = ((uint256(price_) * 1e18) / uint256(ethPrice * 1e16));
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
-               return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
+               return (uint128(ratio), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
            return (0, 0);
        }
    }
```

If you rerun the test after the fix, the amounts should now match.
