# Denial of Service Vulnerability in Multisign Governance Execution

### Summary

The ``Multisign::executeSetterFunction`` lacks access control, enabling any external actor to invoke it. This vulnerability allows an attacker to frontrun legitimate calls, resetting votes prematurely and causing subsequent governance actions to fail. As a result, critical protocol parameters such as treasury address, protocol APR, and LTV cannot be updated, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on governance. The issue can be mitigated by restricting the function's access to specific authorized contracts.

### Root Cause

The ``Multisign::executeSetterFunction`` lacks adequate access controls, allowing any external party to call the function and manipulate its behavior.



### Internal pre-conditions

- The approvedToUpdate mapping must contain votes from legitimate owners who approved the SetterFunctions.
- The number of approvals for a specific setter function must meet or exceed the requiredApprovals threshold.


### External pre-conditions

- An attacker must identify a pending execution of Multisign::executeSetterFunction intended to adjust critical protocol parameters.
- The attacker must act before the legitimate caller can execute the function.


### Attack Path

The vulnerability arises because ``Multisign::executeSetterFunction`` can be invoked by anyone. By exploiting this, an attacker can disrupt the governance process.

1. **Voting Process**:
Owners vote on specific setter functions using ``approveSetterFunction``. Each vote updates the approvedToUpdate mapping.
```solidity
approvedToUpdate[SetterFunctions(functions[i])][msg.sender] = true;
```
2. **Approval Counting**:

The ``getSetterFunctionApproval`` function aggregates the votes to determine if the required approvals are met.
```solidity
if (approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]]) {
    count += 1;
}
```
3. **Execution of Setter Functions**:

When ``executeSetterFunction`` is called, it validates the number of approvals, executes the setter function logic, and resets all approvals to false.
```solidity
approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
```
4. **Frontrunning Attack**:

An attacker frontruns the legitimate call to ``executeSetterFunction`` to prematurely reset the votes, causing the subsequent call to fail as approvals are no longer sufficient.
5. **Impact on Dependent Functions**:

Key setter functions in borrowing.sol rely on the successful execution of ``executeSetterFunction``. The attacker can repeatedly exploit the reset to cause these functions to revert:
```solidity
if (!multiSign.executeSetterFunction(IMultiSign.SetterFunctions(1))) 
    revert Borrow_RequiredApprovalsNotMetToSet();
```


### Impact

The attack effectively denies service to critical protocol operations, including:

- Updating the treasury address
- Adjusting protocol APR
- Modifying the admin address
- Changing Loan-to-Value (LTV) parameters
- Updating the bond ratio
These disruptions could cripple protocol governance and operations.

```solidity
 function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
@>>     require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
@>>         approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
```
- Legitimate owners vote on a setter function.
- An attacker observes an impending call to executeSetterFunction.
- The attacker frontruns the call and invokes executeSetterFunction, resetting all approvals.
- Subsequent calls to execute the setter functions revert due to insufficient approvals.

### Mitigation

Restrict access to ``Multisign::executeSetterFunction`` by implementing a modifier that allows only specific contracts, such as the borrowing.sol contract, to call it.
This ensures that external actors cannot interfere with the execution process, preserving the integrity of the protocol's governance mechanism.
