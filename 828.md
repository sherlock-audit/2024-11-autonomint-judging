# Self transfer of `Abond` token will lead to loss of funds

### Summary

`Abond_Token::transfer()` credits and then [does not](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L133) fetch again the `fromState`, which means in case `to == msg.sender`, the `fromState` will just overwrite the changes to the `toState`, deducting tokens when it should do nothing in a self transfer.

### Root Cause

In `Abond_Token:133`, `fromState` is stale.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User transfer `Abond_Token` to itself.

### Impact

User loses the transferred tokens.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Return if `from` is `to` or refetch `fromState` after changing it.
