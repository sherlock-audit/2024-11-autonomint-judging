# Excess ETH sent from `Treasury:transferFundsToGlobal` to the GlobalVariable contract remains there.

### Summary


The `GlobalVariable` contract accumulates ETH from two sources: the treasury and the destination (dst) chain. While ETH is utilized to pay `nativeFee` for sending OFTs back to the source chain, any excess ETH that remains due to overfunding by the treasury cannot be withdrawn, as the contract lacks a withdrawal function.


### Root Cause

In the GlobalVarialbe contract the contract received ETH from treasury and from dst chain 

```solidity
    // Receive function to get ETH from treaury and receive ETH from dst chain
    receive() external payable {}
```


These amounts are recevied from the treasury during the [_lzReceive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L587-L593) function call 

```solidity
            // Get the funds from treasury, since the sender is global variables contract
            treasury.transferFundsToGlobal([
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.weETHToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.rsETHToSend,
                    oappData.oftTransferData.tokensToSend
                ]
            );
```

these [amounts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L605C6-L628C1) are send back `oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.weETHToSend, oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.rsETHToSend, oappData.oftTransferData.tokensToSend` to src.


```solidity
            // Loop through the OFts to send tokens from this to src
            for (uint8 i = 0; i < tokensToSend.length; i++) {
                if (tokensToSend[i] > 0) {
                    _sendParam = SendParam(
                        dstEid,
                        bytes32(uint256(uint160(oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.recipient))),
                        tokensToSend[i],
                        tokensToSend[i],
                        _options,
                        "0x",
                        "0x"
                    );
                    _fee = usda.quoteSend(_sendParam, false);
                    address assetAddress;
                    if (i == 1) {
                        assetAddress = borrowInstance.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
                    } else {
                        assetAddress = borrowInstance.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName(i + 2));
                    }
                    // Get the Collateal address from borrowing contract
                    IOFT(assetAddress).send{value: _fee.nativeFee}( _sendParam,_fee,address(this));
                }
            }
```


and the [eth](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L595) is used in the nativeFee to Send oft to src chain

```solidity
usda.send{value: _fee.nativeFee}(_sendParam, _fee, address(this));
```

However, we can't calculate a fixed fee for `_fee.nativeFee`; it depends on various factors. If the treasury transfers more ETH to the `GlobalVariable` contract than the `nativeFee`, the excess ETH will be stuck in the contract because we don't have any functionality to withdraw this excess ETH from it.


```solidity
    function transferFundsToGlobal(
        uint256[4] memory transferAmounts
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
        // Loop through the array to transfer all amounts
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            // Transfer only if the amount is greater than zero
            if (transferAmounts[i] > 0) {
                address assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName((i == 3 ? 4 : i) + 1));
                // Transfer tokens if the index not equal to 0, since index 0 is ETH
                if (i != 0) {
                    if (i == 2) {
                        if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();
                        IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
                        assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
                    }
                    bool success = IERC20(assetAddress).transfer(msg.sender, transferAmounts[i]); 
                    if (!success) revert Treasury_TransferFailed();
                } else {
                    // Transfer ETH to global variable contract
@>>                    (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: transferAmounts[i]}(""); 
@>>                    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
                }
            }
        }
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Excess ETH in the GlobalVariables contract cannot be withdrawn, leading to it being stuck in the contract.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a function that allows authorized addresses to withdraw excess ETH.

```solidity
function withdrawExcessETH(address payable recipient) external onlyAuthorized {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    require(balance > 0, "No excess ETH to withdraw");
    (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}(""); 
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```
