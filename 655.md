# Inaccurate Borrowed Amount Store Leading DOS the withdraw of collateral.

### Summary

In the borrowing contract's when minted USDa tokens for users the `BorrowLib::deposit` function  incorrectly stores the full amount of USDa initially calculated for minting (`tokensToMint`) as the `borrowedAmount`, even though the actual amount minted and given to the user is reduced by the `optionFees`. This discrepancy leads to an overestimation of the user's debt, causing to DOS  `borrowing:withDraw` transaction.

### Root Cause


The [BorrowLib.deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L644) function incorrectly stores the  `tokensToMint` as the `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` without accounting for the deduction of `optionFees`. 

```solidity

     //...

     // Call the transfer function to mint USDa
@>>        uint256 tokensToMint = transferToken(
            interfaces.usda,
            libParams.LTV,
            address(interfaces.treasury),
            msg.sender,
            params.depositingAmount,
            libParams.ethPrice,
            optionFees
        );

        // Get global omnichain data
        IGlobalVariables.CollateralData memory collateralData = interfaces.globalVariables.getOmniChainCollateralData(params.assetName);

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in cds to split fees to cds users
        omniChainData.lastCumulativeRate = interfaces.cds.calculateCumulativeRate(uint128(optionFees));
        // Modify omnichain data
        omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees += optionFees;

        //Get the deposit details from treasury
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = interfaces.treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, depositResult.borrowerIndex);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        // Update the borrower details for this index
        depositDetail.depositedAmount = uint128(depositingAmount);
@>>        depositDetail.borrowedAmount = uint128(tokensToMint);
        depositDetail.optionFees = uint128(optionFees);
        depositDetail.APR = libParams.APR;
        depositDetail.exchangeRateAtDeposit = libParams.exchangeRate;

        //..
```


[tokensToMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L549) is calculated as the gross amount of USDa to be minted based on the collateral amount, collateralPrice and LTV.However, the actual amount received by the borrower is `tokensToMint - optionFees`. 

```solidity
    function transferToken(
        
        //...

        tokensToMint = tokensToLend(amount, collateralPrice, LTV);
@>        bool minted = usda.mint(borrower, (tokensToMint - optionFees));

        if (!minted) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_MintFailed();

        //Mint options fees to treasury
       bool treasuryMint = usda.mint(treasuryAddress, optionFees);

        if (!treasuryMint) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_MintFailed();
    }

```

Despite the deduction, the `depositDetail.borrowedAmount = uint128(tokensToMint)` is recorded as the gross `tokensToMint`, not the actual amount minted and transferred for the user.

When a user [withdraws](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L866-L875) their collateral, if the collateral is not ETH, the `discountedCollateral` will be zero. The amount `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` will be burned from the user. The user does not have this amount because they only minted `tokensToMint - optionFees`, not the full `tokensToMint`. As a result, this withdrawal will be reverted due to insufficient USDa balance.

```solidity
                //...

                // Calculate the USDa to burn
@>                uint256 burnValue = depositDetail.borrowedAmount - discountedCollateral;

                // Burn the USDa from the Borrower
                bool success = interfaces.usda.burnFromUser(msg.sender, burnValue);
                if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

                if (downsideProtected > 0) {
                    omniChainData.downsideProtected += downsideProtected;
                }

                //...
```

Example:

If `tokensToMint = 5000e6` and the `optionFees = 100e6`, the actual amount minted for the user by the protocol is `(tokensToMint - optionFees)`, which equals `4900e6` USDa. The `100e6` USDa from the `optionFees` is meant to be claimed by CDS users, not the borrowing user.  

However, the contract incorrectly stores `depositDetail.borrowedAmount = 5000e6`, which is the gross amount. When the user withdraws their collateral, they must transfer back the USDa tokens to complete the withdrawal. In this implementation, a user with only `4900e6` USDa tokens must transfer back `4900e6`, but here the user is required to transfer the full amount of `5000e6`. Since the user does not have this amount, the withdrawal transaction is reverted.


Additional Note:

Based on this implementation, the option fees during the deposit will never be set to zero. Therefore, for every deposit of collateral, whether it's ETH or other tokens, there must be an option fee.

```solidity
        // Call calculateOptionPrice in options contract to get options fees
        uint256 optionFees = interfaces.options.calculateOptionPrice(
            libParams.ethPrice,
            params.volatility,
            params.depositingAmount,
            params.strikePercent
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- Option fees are always non-zero and calculated based on the parameters of the deposit.


### Attack Path


1. A user Deposit collateral and choice some options to get protection from volatile collateral prices, The protocol calculates and mint the amount of USDa for user and option fees for treasury that goes to dCDS users for protected that position.

2. The `transferToken` function mints USDa tokens for the user and a portion (`optionFees`) is deducted from user and transferred to treasury as fees.  

3. The contract records the full value of `tokensToMint = tokensToMint + optionsFees` for the `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` ignoring the actual amount received by the user and `optionsFees` that are not for the users.

4. When a user withdraws their collateral back the amount `depositDetail.borrowedAmount` USDa token will be burned from the user. The user does not have this amount because they only minted `tokensToMint - optionFees`, not the full `tokensToMint`. As a result, this withdrawal will be reverted due to insufficient USDa balance.

5. The user must purchase an additional amount of USDa tokens that is equal to the `optionFees` from the market to withdraw their collateral. This results in a loss of funds for the user.


### Impact

The borrower can't withdraw their collateral back, until they incur a loss of USDa tokens equal to the `optionFees`.

### Mitigation


The solution is to store the correct borrowed amount in the `depositDetail` struct.  Modify the `deposit` function in `BorrowLib` as follows:

```solidity
// ... other code ...

// Call the transfer function to mint USDa
uint256 tokensToMint = transferToken(
    interfaces.usda,
    libParams.LTV,
    address(interfaces.treasury),
    msg.sender,
    params.depositingAmount,
    libParams.ethPrice,
    optionFees
);

// Correct the borrowed amount calculation
uint256 borrowedAmount = tokensToMint - optionFees; 

// ... other code ...

// Update the borrower details for this index
depositDetail.borrowedAmount = uint128(borrowedAmount);

// ... rest of the code ...
```

By subtracting `optionFees` from `tokensToMint` before storing the value in `depositDetail.borrowedAmount`, the contract will accurately reflect the user's debt.  This change ensures that the correct amount of USDa is burned from borrower.
