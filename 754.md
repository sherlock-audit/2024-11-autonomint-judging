# `calculateCumulativeRate` updated wrongly in `_withdraw` leads to wrong interest calculation

### Summary

In `Borrowing::_withdraw` function, `calculateCumulativeRate` is called after `lastEventTime` is set to block.timestamp.
```solidity
function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        ...
            lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);
        }

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
@>      calculateCumulativeRate();
        ...
    }
```
`calculateCumulativeRate` function calls function of BorrowLib and in the 3rd parameter it passes the `lastEventTime` which was set to block.timestamp before calling this function.
```solidity
function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
@>      uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
@>          lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
Now `calculateCumulativeRate` of BorrowLib calculates `currentCumulativeRate` which will be set as `lastCumulativeRate`. For calculation of `currentCumulativeRate` it calculates timeInterval which is the diference between lastEventTime and current block.timestamp.
```solidity
function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
@>          uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            currentCumulativeRate =
                lastCumulativeRate *
                _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
Here, `lastEventTime` is already updated to block.timestamp so that timeInterval will be 0 which means interest will not be updated and remain same.


### Root Cause

`calculateCumulativeRate` is updated after `lastEventTime` is updated to block.timestamp which is wrong.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Interest calculation is depends on timeInterval between current time and lastEventTime. In `_withdraw` function, lastEventTime is set to block.timestamp and then interest is being calculated which means not updated actually.

Therefore everytime when withdraw is being called, interest of that time period (current time - lastEventTime before this function is called) is not being updated.

### Impact

Interest is not being updated correctly in `_withdraw` so that the interest for that time interval are missed for all users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol should make sure that `calculateCumulativeRate` is updated before `lastEventTime` is set to block.timestamp so that interest can be calculated correctly.
