# we should also subtract the downsideProtected from burning

### Summary

in the contract  **withdraw** function **borrowlib**  line 867 when calculating the **burnValue** we should also subtract the  **downsideProtected** as  this variable used to know how much different of amount that we have when depositing and withdrawing   this is our value as the Price is **calculated** again but due to the lie 867 it is **burning**

### Root Cause

in borrowlib line 867 it is not subtracting the **downsideProtected**
