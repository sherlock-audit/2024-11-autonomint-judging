# Floored Logic in Deadline Check for Option Fee in the borrowing `renewOptions` function

### Summary

There is a potential issue in the logic used to check the deadline for option renewal in the `getOptionFeesToPay` function, which is invoked by the `renewOptions` function. The current condition for checking the deadline is flawed because it combines two conflicting comparisons, leading to a situation where the logic will never pass, and the function might revert unnecessarily.

### Root Cause

The problematic code snippet in the deadline check is as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L446-L451
Here, two conditions are being checked simultaneously:

1. `block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days`
2. `block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days`
These conditions are logically inconsistent because:

The first condition checks if the current timestamp is less than 15 days after the `optionsRenewedTimeStamp`.
The second condition checks if the current timestamp is greater than 30 days after the `optionsRenewedTimeStamp`.
For the `block.timestamp` to satisfy both conditions simultaneously, it would have to be both less than 15 days and greater than 30 days after the `optionsRenewedTimeStamp`, which is impossible.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The revert condition will never trigger under valid circumstances, and instead, the code will fail the conditional check incorrectly. and then `renewOptions` never works

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
- if (
-               block.timestamp <
-                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
-                block.timestamp >
-               depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
-           ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();

+ if (
+               block.timestamp >
+                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
+                block.timestamp <
+               depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
+           ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
