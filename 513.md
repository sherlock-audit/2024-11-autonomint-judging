# Incorrect Deduction of update of total cds deposited Amounts During CDS Withdrawal Process

### Summary

The current implementation of the formula for deducting the liquidation amount from the total CDS deposited amount causes incorrect deductions. Specifically, the formula fails to properly handle the case when the liquidation amount is fully subtracted during liquidation and then incorrectly adds back an amount during the withdrawal, causing the total deposited amount to remain higher than expected. This issue arises from the way the liquidationAmount is subtracted from the depositedAmount.

### Root Cause

Incorrect Formula for Deduction:
The formula used to deduct the liquidation amount from the total CDS deposited amount incorrectly subtracts the remaining deposited amount, which causes a miscalculation. In the current implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L728

This only removes the additional portion rather than properly deducting the full liquidation amount from the total deposited amount. 
e.g If the liquidation amount is 100 and the deposited amount is also 100, 
a liquidated borrower liquidatedAmount is 20
during liquidation, the borrower liquidated amount is already deducted from the totalCdsDepositedAmount remaining 80
this formula only removes 20 during the withdrawal, leaving the total deposited amount at 60 when it should be reduced to 0.

these incorrect update is also seen in other variables

`params.omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount`, `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, `params.omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`

### Impact

Incorrect State of `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, `params.omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount`, `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, `params.omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` : These variables,  will be reduced incorrectly, leading to wrong calculations and unexpected issues in functions where they are used

e.g 
1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L495-L504

 the above function is called within
i. borrowing `withdraw` function, 
        https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L647

ii. CDS `withdraw` function
        https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L402
        
iii. in the borrowing `deposit`
        https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L661-L669

### Mitigation

corrected calculations
```solidity
  totalCdsDepositedAmount -= params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - (params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount);
   params.omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount -= params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - (params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount);               

```
