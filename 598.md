# Attacker can use outdated API data in CDS.withdraw()

### Summary

The CDS contract doesn't verify the nonce in `CDS.withdraw()` allowing the caller to use outdated API data.

### Root Cause

When calling `CDS.withdraw()` the user is supposed to pull off-chain data from an API endpoint and pass it to the function together with a signature to verify that the data comes from the API. 

The signed data contains a nonce that allows the system to keep track of the recency of the signed data. But, it doesn't verify that the given data is the latest, i.e. `nonce >= x`. That allows the user to use any piece of data that the API endpoint returned at some point, i.e. outdated data.

In [CDS.sol:878](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L878) the passed nonce isn't verified. The value is given by the user in `CDS.withdraw()` in [CDS.sol:282](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L282)



### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls `withdraw()` with a smaller `excessProfitCumulativeValue` value from an outdated API call, to increase the amount of tokens they receive

### Impact

User receives more tokens than they should on withdrawal.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To guarantee that the data is up to date you need both a nonce and a deadline:
- you keep track of the most recently used nonce. The given nonce has to be equal to or bigger than the stored nonce
- you check whether the data passed its deadline, e.g. `require(block.timestamp < deadline)`.
