# A malicious user can effectively block LiquidationType1

### Summary

This issue arises from an oversight in the BorrowLiquidation contract, where during the liquidation process, the ``msg.value`` is mistakenly sent to the user being liquidated, instead of the intended liquidator. This flaw introduces a risk of malicious actors preventing their liquidation.

### Root Cause

The BorrowLiquidation contract is designed to send ``msg.value`` to the liquidator after a successful liquidation. However, the logic was incorrectly implemented, and ``msg.value`` is being sent to the user being liquidated instead. The specific issue lies in the handling of the liquidationType1 function, where, if ``liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain`` is zero, ``msg.value`` is mistakenly sent to the user being liquidated.

### Impact

Sending ``msg.value`` to the wrong address can lead to financial losses for the liquidator. A malicious user can also exploit this flaw by creating a payable fallback function that ensures the transaction reverts whenever an attempt is made to liquidate their position. This prevents liquidation, rendering their position resistant to liquidationType1.

### PoC

A potential risk is that a malicious user could deploy a fallback function that always reverts, preventing their position from being liquidated. This makes the position effectively resistant to liquidation under certain conditions.

```solidity
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
    (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```


### Mitigation

To fix this, the logic needs to be updated to ensure that ``msg.value`` is sent to the correct address — the liquidator (the transaction originator) — and not the user being liquidated. A proper check and validation should be added to avoid situations where funds are incorrectly transferred. Additionally, safeguards against fallback functions should be considered to prevent malicious exploits.
