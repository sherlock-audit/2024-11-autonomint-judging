# The `liquidationType1` function in the borrowLiquidation contract reverts unexpectedly when calculating the yields

### Summary


The `liquidationType1` function in the borrowLiquidation contract reverts unexpectedly when calculating the yields:

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

This happens when the calculated value of `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)` exceeds `depositDetail.depositedAmount`. This edge case arises due to very small changes in the `exchangeRate` value, leading to an unexpected revert caused by a subtraction of a larger value from a smaller one. This behavior is rooted that not taken the exchange rate that changed to a  smaller value during liquidation.

### Root Cause


When a user deposits collateral, the deposited amount is stored both in terms of the asset (e.g., `WeETH`) and its equivalent in ETH, using the `exchangeRate` at the time of deposit. The calculations are as follows:

1. The user deposits `2e18` `WeETH` tokens with an `exchangeRate` of `1029750180160445400` (`WeETH/ETH`).
2. The deposited amount in ETH is calculated in the deposit function:

```solidity
params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;
```

> params.depositingAmount = (1029750180160445400 * 2e18) / 1 ether = 2059500360320890800


1. The `depositingAmount` in ETH is stored in [depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L179) in the treasury contract:

```solidity
borrowing[user].depositDetails[borrowerIndex].depositedAmountInETH = uint128(depositingAmount); // 2059500360320890800
```

2. Meanwhile, the original [depositingAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L739) (in `WeETH`) is stored in `depositDetail.depositedAmount`:

```solidity
depositDetail.depositedAmount = uint128(depositingAmount); // 2e18
```

### Liquidation Yield Calculation

During liquidation, the [yields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L265) calculation uses the stored `depositDetail.depositedAmount` and `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`:

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

If the `exchangeRate` has slightly decreased (e.g., by 1 wei), the denominator in the division becomes slightly smaller, making the result of `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)` slightly larger. As a result, this value can exceed `depositDetail.depositedAmount`, leading to an underflow (revert).

For example:

- At deposit:
  - `depositDetail.depositedAmount = 2e18`
  - `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH = 2059500360320890800`
  - `exchangeRate = 1029750180160445400`

- At liquidation:
  - New `exchangeRate = 1029750180160445399` (slightly decreased by 1 wei).

- Yield calculation:

```js
yields = 2e18 - ((2059500360320890800 * 1 ether) / 1029750180160445399)  -->   `-1`
```

Substitute values:

```js
yields = 2e18 - 2000000000000000001 = -1 (revert the liquidation)
```


Here, the logic is implemented in such a way that it assumes the exchange rate of ETH-backed assets like WeETH or WrETH will never decrease if the ETH price increases, but this is incorrect.

If we check the very latest data on chainlink data feeds of ETH/USD  and weETH/ETH on the optimism network:

1. ETH/USD: https://data.chain.link/feeds/optimism/mainnet/eth-usd
2. weETH/ETH: https://data.chain.link/feeds/optimism/mainnet/weeth-eth


Based on that feeds if a user deposits collateral on December 18 with an ETH price of 393133, and by December 21 the price has decreased to 347491, the ETH price has decreased significantly. Based on the protocol's logic, this position should be liquidated. However, the protocol team assumes that if the price of ETH decreased, the ETH-backed tokens, like weETH or wrsETH (which the protocol accepts as deposits), will not affected. This is not always the case.

If we check the Chainlink price feed for weETH:

On December 18, the exchange rate was 1.0550. By December 21, although the price of ETH had decreased significantly, the price of weETH also decreased. On December 21, the exchange rate was 1.0549 so the exchange rate is decreased. This discrepancy will definitely cause the liquidation to revert based on the calculated yields.

### Impact

Positions eligible for liquidation may fail to liquidate due to unexpected reverts.


### PoC

1. Deposit `2e18` `WeETH` with an `exchangeRate` of `1029750180160445400`.
   - `depositDetail.depositedAmount = 2e18`.
   - `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH = 2059500360320890800`.

2. Trigger liquidation when the `exchangeRate` decrease slightly (e.g., `1029750180160445399`).

3. Observe the revert during yield calculation:

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

### Mitigation


Here, we don't know whether the exchange rate returned from the oracle is larger or smaller. If it's larger, there is no problem, but if the exchange rate returned from the oracle is smaller, it will revert.

I don't know the best logic implemented that ensures liquidation does not revert.


```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

One way to completely remove this is because the result of this calculation is pass to `treasury.updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts(yields);`.

If we check in the treasury, its only increment the `yieldsFromLiquidatedLrts` and, this state variable is never used in any calculation in the protocol.

```solidity
    function updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts(
        uint256 yields
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
        yieldsFromLiquidatedLrts += yields;
    }
