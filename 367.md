# Attacker will Deny Service by Manipulating downsideProtected in updateDownsideProtected()

### Summary

There isn't bounds and access control in `updateDownsideProtected()` with easy steps the attacker will cause protocol-wide Denial of Service **(DoS)** for legitimate users as an attacker will call the function with a **massive value** to artificially lower `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, triggering reverts and breaking the system's accounting.

### Root Cause

**First Location of the issue**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829-L830
 In `CDS.sol:830`, the function `updateDownsideProtected()` allows **anyone** to arbitrarily increase the `downsideProtected` value without restriction:
    
   ```solidity
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
    
```
    
    
Simply what will happen that the `downsideProtected` value is subtracted from` totalCdsDepositedAmount` in `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` (CDS.sol:833):

- If `downsideProtected` is set to an absurdly high value, `totalCdsDepositedAmount` may become negative or revert due to underflow, breaking the protocol’s accounting.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L833-L839

 The vulnerability is **explicit**: any user can inflate `downsideProtected` arbitrarily. The subsequent subtraction in `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` is based on that unvalidated integer, destroying the internal accounting of `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.
- This **breaks** the coverage ratio logic, effectively causing mass reverts or “CDS_NotEnoughFundInCDS” conditions, halting deposits, withdrawals, or valid coverage flows.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `downsideProtected` variable is set to an excessively high value by an unauthorized user.

### External pre-conditions

An external user calls the `updateDownsideProtected()` function with a large `downsideProtectedAmount`.

### Attack Path

Suppose that the protocol currently has `totalCdsDepositedAmount = 500,000 USDa`.
- The `downsideProtected` value is near zero or a small number.

A malicious user calls: sets` downsideProtected `to an extremely large value with no cost besides gas.
    
 
  `  cds.updateDownsideProtected(1_000_000_000e18); // Sets an arbitrarily high downsideProtected`
    
**There is no restriction preventing them from doing so.**

**Now downsideProtected = 1,000,000,000e18, an absurdly large number relative to real deposits.**
    
**Trigger**:
The next deposit or withdrawal invokes `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` during its execution. This function subtracts the unvalidated `downsideProtected` from `totalCdsDepositedAmount`:
        
        

```solidity
 totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
        downsideProtected = 0;
```


        
        
        
 With `downsideProtected = 1,000,000,000e18`, the subtraction reduces `totalCdsDepositedAmount` to a huge negative value or reverts due to underflow.


### **Summarized attack path**:

1. An attacker invokes the `updateDownsideProtected()` function with a large value, significantly increasing the `downsideProtected` variable.
2. A legitimate user performs a deposit or withdrawal operation, triggering the `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()` function.
3. Within this function, the inflated `downsideProtected` value is subtracted from `totalCdsDepositedAmount`, potentially causing it to become negative or zero.

### consequences:
- **Denial of Service**:
    - Any function relying on `totalCdsDepositedAmount` (e.g., `calculateRatio()`, `deposit()`, `withdraw()`) reverts with `CDS_NotEnoughFundInCDS`.
    - Legitimate users are blocked from interacting with the protocol.
- **Protocol Disruption**:
    - System-wide accounting errors occur, potentially freezing operations. 

### Impact

 **Impact**:
    - The system sees `totalCdsDepositedAmount` as drastically reduced or zero.
    - Many protocol checks require `totalCdsDepositedAmount >= some threshold` (e.g., `calculateRatio(...)` might revert with `CDS_NotEnoughFundInCDS` if coverage is below 0.2 ratio).
     **Result**:
        - **Denial of Service** for legitimate users wanting to deposit or withdraw.
        - Potential forced or unexpected reverts in core flows.
        - The CDS coverage ratio logic breaks—**the system incorrectly thinks all coverage is gone.**
        
 **Attacker Benefit**:
    - **System-wide disruption** (a potent denial of service) is itself a weapon:
        - They might freeze new deposits/withdrawals so no one can use CDS.
        - If forced liquidation or ratio-based triggers exist, the attacker might push the protocol into a “frozen” or erroneous liquidation state—**thereby profiting** if they can buy liquidated collateral cheaply or sabotage certain positions.
        
Even if the attacker gains no direct tokens, they can cause heavy financial **losses** for other users stuck in undercollateralized or un-withdrawable positions. This is an **attack** on protocol availability and correctness.

}
```

### Mitigation

By design if access control isn't needed then **add bounds check** to control the issue environment and prevent **System-Wide DoS**

**Validation**:
    - Add bounds checks to ensure `downsideProtected` remains within realistic and permissible limits.
    - Example:
        
     
```solidity
        function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
            require(downsideProtectedAmount < MAX_DOWNSIDE, "Exceeds max allowable downside");
            downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
        }
```
