# Sending excess msg.value to user which is being liquidated instead to the msg.sender/admin can lead to DoS

### Summary
An admin which wants to liquidate a borrowers position could accidentally send excessive amounts to the borrower getting liquidated. This could also lead to DoS.

### Root Cause
In the liquidation logic in borrowLiquidation.sol we might need to send msg.value, in case we have liquidation amounts to take from the other chain, however in the case where we don't have, the excessive value to the user which is liquidated.

```solidity
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
            //issue Hm why do we send eth to user here? It should be refunded back to owner if not used.
            (bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```

### Impact
- Loss of funds, instead of being refunded to the admin they are sent to the liquidated user.
- Since borrower is called and the transaction is required to be successful, if borrower is a contract he could DoS the transaction by intentionally making it fail by adding code in the `receive/fallback` functions which checks if the funds are from the address of the `borrowLiquidation.sol` contract, and if so - `revert()`, thus avoiding liquidation.
 
### Mitigation
```diff
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
-           (bool sent,) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
+           (bool sent,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: msg.value}(""); 
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```
