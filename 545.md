# Yield Theft in redeemYields Function

### Summary

A parameter mismatch in redeemYields calculation will cause a theft of yields for ABOND holders as attackers will be able to extract yields calculated from any user's state while only burning their own ABOND tokens.


### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib.sol:redeemYields` called via `Borrowing:redeemYields` at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L978 the function calculates yields based on an arbitrary user's state (`user` parameter) but burns ABOND tokens from `msg.sender`, creating a critical mismatch between yield calculation and token burning.

```solidity
// Yields calculated from user parameter
State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
...
// But ABOND burned from msg.sender
bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount);
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a victim with significant accumulated yields
2. Attacker obtains a small amount of ABOND tokens
3. Attacker calls `redeemYields(victim, attackerBondAmount)`
4. Yields are calculated based on victim's state (higher yields)
5. ABOND tokens are burned from attacker's balance (lower amount)
6. Attacker receives yields they didn't earn


### Impact

The victim suffers a loss of their rightfully earned yields, which can be significant depending on:
1. The victim's accumulated ethBacked amount
2. The victim's cumulativeRate
3. The duration they've held their position

Specific value extraction example:
- Victim has 10 ETH backing and 150% cumulative rate
- Attacker has 1 ETH backing and 100% cumulative rate
- Attacker can extract yields calculated on 10 ETH while only burning ABOND backed by 1 ETH
