# An attacker can disrupt multisgn quorum on setter functions.

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

`Multisign::executeSetterFunction` can be called by anyone

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path
The Multisign contract serves as a voting mechanism, where owners can vote on certain decisions. there is a `requiredApprovals` number that must be met, for conclusions to be made on a decision. Owners cast their votes using the `approveSetterFunction` function below. Focus on the last line of the snippet,  the `approvedToUpdate` mapping is set to true for each voter.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L125
```solidity
    function approveSetterFunction(
        uint8[] memory functions
    ) external onlyOwners {
        uint8 noOfFunctions = uint8(functions.length);
        // Check, the given functions are not empty
        require(noOfFunctions > 0, "Empty array");
        // Loop through the functions to approve setter functions
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < noOfFunctions; i++) {
            // Check, the caller(owner) has already approved to set given function
            require(!approvedToUpdate[SetterFunctions(functions[i])][msg.sender],"Already approved");
            // Change the mapping to true
@>>         approvedToUpdate[SetterFunctions(functions[i])][msg.sender] = true;
        }
    }
```

The next snippet below does the overall counting of the number of votes, and returns the number of owners who have voted
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L258-L269
```solidity
    function getSetterFunctionApproval(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) private view returns (uint64) {
        uint64 count;
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and get the approval count
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            // Check the owner has approved function to set
@>>         if (approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]]) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
When the executeSetterFunction function below is called, It excecutes its line of codes and assume that the vote has already been used by setting all the votes in the `approvedToUpdate` mapping back to false.
```solidity  
  function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
@>>     require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
@>>         approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
   ``` 

Since all the important setter functions in borrowing.sol performs a similar check in the snippet below;
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L178C24-L178C45
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L214
```solidity
if (!multiSign.executeSetterFunction(IMultiSign.SetterFunctions(1))) revert Borrow_RequiredApprovalsNotMetToSet();
```

An attacker can always frontrun this call by calling the `multisign::executeSetterFunction` which will always reset all votes to false, hence causing `executeSetterFunction` functions to revert.


### Impact

This will DOS setting core variables within the protocol such as 
1. Treasury address
2. Protocol APR
3. Admin address 
4. LTV
5. BondRatio

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Put a modifier on the function; Only the borrowing contract should call it.
