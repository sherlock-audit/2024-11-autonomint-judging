# No refund of excess value in the liquidation function to liquidators

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L389C9-L409C6

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L389C9-L409C6
        // Call the liquidateBorrowPosition function in borrowLiquidation contract
        CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo = borrowLiquidation
            .liquidateBorrowPosition{value: msg.value - fee.nativeFee}(
            user,
            index,
            uint64(ethPrice),
            liquidationType,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );


        // Calling Omnichain send function
        globalVariables.sendForLiquidation{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(2),
            noOfLiquidations,
            liquidationInfo,
            getBorrowingResult.depositDetails.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
    }

From the liquidate function above, All ETH is split between liquidation and cross-chain fee but the excess ETH sent by user/liquidator is never refunded. This leads to trapped ETH in contract and loss for users/liquidators.

// simplification of the ETH allocation:
liquidation_amount = msg.value - fee.nativeFee
cross_chain_fee = fee.nativeFee
total_used = liquidation_amount + cross_chain_fee
excess = msg.value - total_used  

As can be seen again, there is no mechanism to refund the excess to the user which means loss to the user/liquidator. The excess is trapped in the contract.
