# lastEthprice is not updated on borrower's deposit

### Summary

lastEthprice is not updated on borrower's deposit which leads to incorrectly tracked `cdsPoolValue` which means cds holders might be stuck.

### Root Cause
When call happens: `borrowing.depositTokens`, `lastEthprice` not updated.

net P/L of CDS Pool will be always updating as eth price is not tracked properly. E.x. two depositor did call at the same time, this means profits will be doubled or losses will be doubled for the pool and not only once, until someone call withdraw on borrowing contract because thats the only place where lastEthprice updated
```solidity
    function calculateRatio(
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 currentEthPrice,
        uint128 lastEthprice,
        uint256 noOfDeposits,
        uint256 totalCollateralInETH,
        uint256 latestTotalCDSPool,
        IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory previousData
    ) public pure returns (uint64, IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory) {
        uint256 netPLCdsPool;

        // Calculate net P/L of CDS Pool
        // if the current eth price is high
        if (currentEthPrice > lastEthprice) {
            // profit, multiply the price difference with total collateral
->            netPLCdsPool = (((currentEthPrice - lastEthprice) * totalCollateralInETH) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100;
        } else {
            // loss, multiply the price difference with total collateral
->            netPLCdsPool = (((lastEthprice - currentEthPrice) * totalCollateralInETH) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100;
        }
...
    }

Which means ratio will not be tracked properly and some cds holders will not be able to withdraw due to the fact they will be forced to protect against positions that do not exist.

```solidity
        // Check whether after withdraw cds have enough funds to protect borrower's collateral
        if (withdrawResult.omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei != 0) {
            if (borrowing.calculateRatio(0, ethPrice) < (2 * CDSLib.RATIO_PRECISION)) revert CDS_NotEnoughFundInCDS();
        }
```
### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

always happening

### Impact

1. Cds holder will be forced to protect against positions that do not exist. Their deposits will be stuck
2. borrowers will not be able to deposits when they should

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
        totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
            BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
                LTV,
                APR,
                lastCumulativeRate,
                totalNormalizedAmount,
                exchangeRate,
                ethPrice,
                lastEthprice
            ),
            depositParam,
            Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options),
            assetAddress
        );
+        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
