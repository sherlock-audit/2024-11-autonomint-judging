# An attacker can steal funds from treasury.

### Summary

Wrong implementation of `borrowing.redeemYields()` will cause loss of eth for protocol as an attacker will redeem more yields by burning `aBond` with low `ethBacked`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1032

### Root Cause

- In `BorrowLib.sol:1032`, the protocol burns abond of wrong address, `msg.sender` instead of user.
```solidity
    function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        // check abond amount is non zewro
        if (aBondAmount == 0) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
        IABONDToken abond = IABONDToken(abondAddress);
        // get user abond state
        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
        // check user have enough abond
992@>   if (aBondAmount > userState.aBondBalance) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InsufficientBalance();

        ...

        //Burn the usda from treasury
        treasury.approveTokens(
            IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa,
            borrow,
            (usdaToBurn + usdaToTransfer)
        );

        IUSDa usda = IUSDa(usdaAddress);
        // burn the usda
        bool burned = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), usdaToBurn);
        if (!burned) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        if (usdaToTransfer > 0) {
            // transfer usda to user
            bool transferred = usda.contractTransferFrom(
                address(treasury),
                user,
                usdaToTransfer
            );
            if (!transferred) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_TransferFailed();
        }
        // withdraw eth from ext protocol
1029@>  uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

1031    //Burn the abond from user
1032@>  bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount); @ audit - this is wrong.
        if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        return withdrawAmount;
    }
```
From `doc` on L1031, we can see about wrong implementation of L1032.   
In fact, on L992 user's state is checked, not state of `msg.sender`. And on L1029 it sends eth according to user's state.
```solidity
    File: Treasury.sol
    function withdrawFromExternalProtocol(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
        if (user == address(0)) revert Treasury_ZeroAddress();

        // Withdraw from external protocols
@>      uint256 redeemAmount = withdrawFromIonicByUser(user, aBondAmount);
        // Send the ETH to user
@>      (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        // check the transfer is successfull or not
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        return redeemAmount;
    }
    ...
    function withdrawFromIonicByUser(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) internal nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentExchangeRate = ionic.exchangeRateCurrent();
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = _calculateCumulativeRate(currentExchangeRate, Protocol.Ionic);

        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
@>      uint128 depositedAmount = (aBondAmount * userState.ethBacked) / PRECISION;
        uint256 normalizedAmount = (depositedAmount * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / userState.cumulativeRate;

        //withdraw amount
        uint256 amount = (currentCumulativeRate * normalizedAmount) / CUMULATIVE_PRECISION;
        // withdraw from ionic
@>      ionic.redeemUnderlying(amount);

        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].totalCreditedTokens = ionic.balanceOf(address(this));
        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].exchangeRate = currentExchangeRate;
        // convert weth to eth
        WETH.withdraw(amount);
        return amount;
    }
```

### Attack Path

- We say that an attacker uses two addresses with abond. Each has `1e18` of abond. And First has `ethBacked = 1.5e18`, second has `ethBacked = 1.0e18`.
- The attacker calls `borrowing.sol#redeemYields` with `user = first address` and `msg.sender = second address`.
- Then, eth is sent to the attacker with high `ethBacked` than normal. This is the attacker's earn.
- Because of zero-sum, this is protocol's loss.


### Impact

The protocol loses eth by an attacker using vulnerability of `borrowing.sol#redeemYields()`.


### PoC

### Mitigation

`BorrowLib.sol#redeemYields()` function has to be modified as follows. We can consider changing `msg.sender` to user but then an attacker can prevent user's earning through external protocol - ionic.
```solidity
    function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {
++      require(user == msg.sender);

        // check abond amount is non zewro
        if (aBondAmount == 0) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
        IABONDToken abond = IABONDToken(abondAddress);
        // get user abond state
        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
        // check user have enough abond
        if (aBondAmount > userState.aBondBalance) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InsufficientBalance();

        ...

        IUSDa usda = IUSDa(usdaAddress);
        // burn the usda
        bool burned = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), usdaToBurn);
        if (!burned) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        if (usdaToTransfer > 0) {
            // transfer usda to user
            bool transferred = usda.contractTransferFrom(
                address(treasury),
                user,
                usdaToTransfer
            );
            if (!transferred) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_TransferFailed();
        }
        // withdraw eth from ext protocol
        uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

        //Burn the abond from user
--      bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount);
++      bool success = abond.burnFromUser(user, aBondAmount);  @ dev: this is more readable.
        if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        return withdrawAmount;
    }
```
