# User unable to swap usda to usdt because lack of tracking usdt within protocol

### Summary

inside CDSlib.sol deposit() we check if usdtLimit fulfilled and if it's fulfilled we let user to deposit usda
```solidity
            if (
                (omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow +
                    params.usdtAmount) <= params.usdtLimit
            ) {
                // Check the totalDepositingAmount is usdt amount
                if (params.usdtAmount != totalDepositingAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_NeedsUSDTOnly();//@audit really sus here
            } else { 
                revert CDSInterface.CDS_SurplusUSDT();
            }
```
Important note: usdtLimit - minimum amount of usdt protocol want to hold on order to be solvent instantly swap usda to usdt

Protocol support price of usda token to offering ability to swap it to usdt. 
But we do not track usdt amount within the system - usdtAmountDepositedTillNow . When we process usda to usdt swap we should ensure, that total amount of usdt in system won't fall bellow usdtLimit in order to force cds depositors to start deposit only usdt until usdtLimit will fulfilied.

### Root Cause

missing adjusting of usdtAmountDepositedTillNow in redeemUSDT()

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The users depositing usdt until usdtLimit will be reached
Another user redeeming usdt for usda
When it will be not enough to usdt within protocol, users won't be able to redeem usdt which will lead to protocol insolvency and dropping price of usda at external markets

### Impact

protocol insolvency and dropping price of usda at external markets

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

ensure you keeps track of usdt amount within protocol with adjusting  usdtAmountDepositedTillNow variable after redeeming usdt
