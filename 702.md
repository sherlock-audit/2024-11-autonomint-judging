# user being liquidated can prevent type1 liquidations if `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0` by causing unexpected reverts

### Summary

There's an external call to user being liquidated whenever `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0`
```solidity
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");//@audit-issue user being liquidated can prevent type1 liquidations if liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0 by causing unexpected reverts  (smart contracts/ smart contract wallets) 
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```

Malicious users can revert the liquidation txs when called.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the external call done to the user [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L302-L305) 

```solidity
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```
An external call is done to the user being liquidated whenever `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0`.  The issue with this is that if the user is a malicious contract that reverts abruptly in its receive() or fallback() function, it will never be possible to liquidate such a user. 


### Internal pre-conditions

1. liquidation needs to be type1  liquidation.

2.`liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0` during the liquidation.

### External pre-conditions

1. user being liquidated needs to be a malicious smart contract / smart contract wallet

### Attack Path

1. User creates and uses a malicious contract to interact with the system.

2. The payable function has logic that can be activated to cause abrupt reverts making liquidating him impossible.

### Impact

user being liquidated can prevent type1 liquidations if `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0` by causing unexpected reverts 

This will result in protocol insolvency. Such Users that can't be liquidated will cause the protocol bad debts




### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of sending ETHER to the user in the liquidationType1 process... maybe save the ETHER amount to be sent back somewhere and have them claim it later.
