# Missing Liquidation State Update in liquidationType

### Summary

The liquidationType2 function in the borrowLiquidation contract does not update the liquidation state of the deposit. This allows users to withdraw their collateral even though they should have been liquidated, while the short position on Synthetix still exists.

### Root Cause

The function fails to set depositDetail.liquidated to true after performing the liquidation process. This omission allows users to bypass the liquidation status check and withdraw their collateral.

```solidity
    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");

        // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000, "You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

        uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);

        // Convert the ETH into WETH
        weth.deposit{value: amount}();
        // Approve it, to mint sETH
        bool approved = weth.approve(address(wrapper), amount);

        if (!approved) revert BorrowLiq_ApproveFailed();

        // Mint sETH
        wrapper.mint(amount);
        // Exchange sETH with sUSD
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );

        // Calculate the margin
        int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        // Transfer the margin to synthetix
        synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);

        // Submit an offchain delayed order in synthetix for short position with 1X leverage
        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
            -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
            currentEthPrice * 1e16
        );
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user's position becomes eligible for liquidation.
2. The liquidationType2 function is called, performing the liquidation process but not updating the liquidated state.
3. The user can still withdraw their collateral when ETH price increase because the liquidated state is not set to true.
4. The short position on Synthetix remains open, potentially leading to financial loss.

### Impact

Users withdrawing collateral that should have been liquidated.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the liquidationType2 function to set depositDetail.liquidated to true after performing the liquidation process.
