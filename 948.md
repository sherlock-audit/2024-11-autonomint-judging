# Gas griefing is possible when admin perform liquidation actions

## Vulnerability Details

When transferring ETH token, the following pattern is used in multiple cases:

```solidity
(bool sent, ) = payable(receiver).call{
                value: msg.value
            }("");
```

This works well in most cases because msg.sender refers to the user themselves. However, in the context of liquidation, the situation changes:

```solidity
function liquidationType1(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
        ......
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
        ...
    }
```
[code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L302-L305)

This function allows `admin(msg.sender)` liquidate borrowers' unhealthy debts with liquidationType1, opening up a attack-vector in the contract and it is gas griefing on the ETH transfer. Now `(bool sent, )` is actually the same as writing `(bool sent, bytes memory data)` which basically means that even though the `data` is omitted it doesn’t mean that the contract does not handle it. Actually, the way it works is the `bytes data` that was returned from the `user` will be copied to memory. Memory allocation becomes very costly if the payload is big, so this means that if a `user` implements a fallback function that returns a huge payload, then the `msg.sender` of the transaction, in our case the `admin`, will have to pay a huge amount of gas for copying this payload to memory.

## Impact

Malicious actor can launch a gas griefing attack on the admin, resulting in loss of funds for the administrator.

## Recommended mitigation

Use a low-level assembly `call` since it does not automatically copy return data to memory：

```solidity
bool sent;
assembly {
    sent := call(3000, user, amount, 0, 0, 0, 0)
}
```
