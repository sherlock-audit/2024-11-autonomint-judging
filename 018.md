# Incorrect price calculations in MasterPriceOracle allow for profitable arbitrage attacks.

### Summary

The inadequate precision in the price calculations due to improper handling of values will cause a significant financial impact for stakers as the attacker will exploit the rounding errors to manipulate asset valuations.

### Root Cause

In [MasterPriceOracle.sol:53](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L53-L96) the rounding errors in the price calculations lead to incorrect asset valuations.
