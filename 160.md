# `withdrawInterest` can't withdraw from the protocol the `totalInterestFromLiquidation`

### Summary

The `withdrawInterest` function is responsible for withdrawing accrued interest. However, it only deducts the amount from `totalInterest` and does not consider `totalInterestFromLiquidation` for withdrawals. Consequently, it is not possible to withdraw any interest accumulated from liquidations, as the function exclusively interacts with `totalInterest`.

```solidity
function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
        require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
        totalInterest -= amount; // audit what about totalInterestFromLiquidation
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```

### Root Cause

The function fails to incorporate `totalInterestFromLiquidation` in the withdrawal process in deducting from the available balance.

### Impact

Any funds accumulated in totalInterestFromLiquidation are effectively inaccessible.

### PoC

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   Assume the following initial state of the contract variables:  
   - `totalInterest = 1000`  
   - `totalInterestFromLiquidation = 500`

2. **User Action**:  
   The owner calls the `withdrawInterest` function to withdraw `1100` units of interest:  
   ```solidity
   withdrawInterest(toAddress, 1100);
   ```

3. **Expected Behavior**:  
   The combined total interest (`totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation`) is `1000 + 500 = 1500`, which is sufficient to cover the withdrawal. The withdrawal should succeed by deducting `1000` from `totalInterest` and `100` from `totalInterestFromLiquidation`.

4. **Actual Behavior**:  
   The function performs the following checks and operations:
   - The `require` statement checks if `amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation)` and passes because `1100 <= 1500`.  
   - The function then deducts the `amount` solely from `totalInterest`:  
     ```solidity
     totalInterest -= amount;
     ```
     Since `totalInterest = 1000`, subtracting `1100` results in an underflow, causing the function to revert or fail due to insufficient balance in `totalInterest`.

5. **Outcome**:  
   - The transaction fails, even though the treasury has sufficient funds in total (`totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation = 1500`), because the logic does not utilize `totalInterestFromLiquidation` for withdrawals.  
   - The error message returned is:  
     ```solidity
     "Treasury doesn't have enough interest"
     ```

This demonstrates the inability of the function to handle withdrawals that exceed `totalInterest` but are within the combined total of `totalInterest` and `totalInterestFromLiquidation`.

### Mitigation

You can change the code in the following way:

```solidity
function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0, "Input address or amount is invalid");
        require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation), "Treasury doesn't have enough interest");

        if (amount <= totalInterest) {
            totalInterest -= amount;
        } else {
            uint256 remainingAmount = amount - totalInterest;
            totalInterest = 0;
            totalInterestFromLiquidation -= remainingAmount;
        }

        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```
