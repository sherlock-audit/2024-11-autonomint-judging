# Lack of lastEthPrice sync between different chains

### Summary

The missing sync of lastEthPrice will cause incorrect cds cumulative value calculation.

### Root Cause

When users deposit or withdraw in cds, we will timely [update the cds cumulative value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L489-L502).

We will calculate the cds gain/loss according to the ether price change from lastEthPrice to current Ether price. We will update the lastEthPrice after our calculation.

The problem is that the cds gain/loss stands for the total cds deposit's gain or loss including Op chain and Mode chain. We just update the `lastEthPrice` variable in current chain and don't sync with the other chain. When users deposit/withdraw in the other chain and calculate the cds gain/loss accroding to the ether price change, we will re-calculate the previous gain/loss because of the un-synced lastEthPrice.

For example:
1. Alice deposits in OP Chain in timestamp X. `lastEthPrice` = 3500 USD.
2. Bob deposits in Mode Chain in timestamp X. `lastEthPrice` = 3500 USD.
3. Cathy deposits in OP chain in timestamp X + 100, current Ether price = 4000 USD. We will calculate the cds gain/loss bettwne timestamp X and timestamp X + 100. The gain/loss will be updated to global variable `omniChainData.cumulativeValue` and `omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign`. `lastEthPrice` in OP Chain is updated to 4000 USD.
4. Dean deposits in Mode Chain in timestamp X + 200, current Ether price = 4000 USD. When we calculate the cds gain/loss, we will calculate the gain/loss from 3500 USD to 4000 USD because the `lastEthPrice` is still 3500 USD. This will cause the gain/loss will be calculated repeatedly.
  
```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeValue(
        uint128 _price, // current ether price
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount, // usda amount in the treasury
        uint128 lastEthPrice, // last ether price
        uint256 vaultBal // collateral ether amount
    ) public pure returns (CDSInterface.CalculateValueResult memory) {
            if (_price > lastEthPrice) {
                priceDiff = _price - lastEthPrice;
                gains = true;
            } else {
                priceDiff = lastEthPrice - _price;
                gains = false;
            }
            value = uint128((_amount * vaultBal * priceDiff * 1e6) / (PRECISION * totalCdsDepositedAmount));
}

```
```solidity
        if (ethPrice != lastEthPrice) {
            updateLastEthPrice(ethPrice);
        }
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits in OP Chain in timestamp X. `lastEthPrice` = 3500 USD.
2. Bob deposits in Mode Chain in timestamp X. `lastEthPrice` = 3500 USD.
3. Cathy deposits in OP chain in timestamp X + 100, current Ether price = 4000 USD. We will calculate the cds gain/loss bettwne timestamp X and timestamp X + 100. The gain/loss will be updated to global variable `omniChainData.cumulativeValue` and `omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign`. `lastEthPrice` in OP Chain is updated to 4000 USD.
4. Dean deposits in Mode Chain in timestamp X + 200, current Ether price = 4000 USD. When we calculate the cds gain/loss, we will calculate the gain/loss from 3500 USD to 4000 USD because the `lastEthPrice` is still 3500 USD. This will cause the gain/loss will be calculated repeatedly.
  

### Impact

The cds cumulative value calculation will be incorrect. This will cause cds owner's withdraw amount will be incorrect, more or less than expected.

### Mitigation

Sync the `lastEthPrice` with the other chain.
