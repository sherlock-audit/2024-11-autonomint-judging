# Cross-Chain Reward Double-Claiming Due to View Function State Modification in CDS Contract

## Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the CDS contract where the `calculateLiquidatedETHTogiveToUser` view function incorrectly simulates liquidation reward calculations by modifying a memory state variable (`cdsDepositData.liquidationAmount`) that isn't persisted. 

The vulnerability becomes exploitable in cross-chain scenarios due to the function's interaction with the withdrawal mechanism. When a user initiates a withdrawal on Chain A, the contract first calculates their rewards using `calculateLiquidatedETHTogiveToUser`, then processes the withdrawal. However, since the function's memory modifications aren't persisted and there's no cross-chain state synchronization, the same user can move to Chain B and withdraw again - the calculation function will show the full rewards as still being available.

This creates a fundamental break in the protocol's liquidation accounting system. Each chain independently calculates and distributes what it believes to be the user's legitimate share of rewards, effectively allowing multiple claims against the same liquidation event. The exploitability scales directly with the size of liquidation events, as larger liquidations mean larger duplicate rewards can be extracted across chains.

Most critically, this exploitation path directly impacts other users of the protocol. Since the total reward pool is finite, these duplicate claims dilute or completely drain the rewards available to legitimate users. The protocol's cross-chain accounting becomes permanently desynchronized, with each successful exploit making the disparity between intended and actual reward distribution wider.

## Proof of Concept

An attacker monitors for large liquidation events and executes the following sequence:

1. When a large liquidation of 1000 ETH occurs, attacker deposits 100 USDa with liquidation participation opted in
2. Attacker queries `calculateLiquidatedETHTogiveToUser` showing they are eligible for 200 ETH reward (based on their share)
3. Executes `withdraw()` on Chain A:
   - Gets 200 ETH reward
   - Contract believes rewards are properly distributed

4. Immediately moves to Chain B:
   - The same deposit position still appears eligible for full rewards
   - Because `calculateLiquidatedETHTogiveToUser` is showing fresh calculations
   - Executes another `withdraw()`, receiving another 200 ETH

5. This can be repeated across N chains, each time extracting the full 200 ETH reward
   - Original 100 USDa deposit generates N*200 ETH in rewards
   - Each withdrawal appears valid in isolation
   - Other users' queries to `calculateLiquidatedETHTogiveToUser` show diminished rewards

This results in the attacker extracting far more than their proportional share, while legitimate users receive reduced or zero rewards when they attempt to withdraw.

## Recommended mitigation steps
The core issue requires restructuring how reward calculations and claims are tracked across chains. The view function should be redesigned to perform read-only calculations without state modifications:

```solidity
// Add at contract level
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public claimedLiquidations;

function calculateLiquidatedETHTogiveToUser(
    address user,
    uint64 index
) external view returns (uint256, uint256, uint128, uint256) {
    CDSInterface.CdsAccountDetails memory cdsDepositData = cdsDetails[user].cdsAccountDetails[index];
    IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory omniChainData = globalVariables.getOmniChainData();
    
    uint256 returnAmount = (cdsDepositData.normalizedAmount * omniChainData.lastCumulativeRate) / CDSLib.PRECISION;
    
    if (!cdsDepositData.optedLiquidation) {
        return (returnAmount, priceChangePL, 0, 0);
    }

    // Calculate available unclaimed rewards
    (uint256 rewards, uint256 ethAmount) = calculateUnclaimedRewards(
        user, 
        index,
        cdsDepositData.liquidationindex,
        omniChainData.noOfLiquidations,
        cdsDepositData.liquidationAmount
    );

    return (returnAmount + rewards, priceChangePL, uint128(rewards), ethAmount);
}

function calculateUnclaimedRewards(
    address user,
    uint64 depositIndex,
    uint128 startIndex,
    uint128 endIndex,
    uint128 liquidationAmount
) private view returns (uint256 rewards, uint256 ethAmount) {
    for (uint128 i = startIndex + 1; i <= endIndex; i++) {
        bytes32 claimId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user, depositIndex, i));
        
        // Skip if already claimed
        if (claimedLiquidations[claimId]) continue;
        
        LiquidationInfo memory liquidationData = omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo[i];
        uint128 share = (liquidationAmount * 1e10) / uint128(liquidationData.availableLiquidationAmount);
        
        rewards += (liquidationData.profits * share) / 1e10;
        ethAmount += (liquidationData.collateralAmount * share) / 1e10;
    }
}
```

This ensures reward calculations and claims remain consistent across chains while maintaining accurate global state. The withdrawal process becomes atomic with proper verification before processing claims.
