# lastethprice is not updated function in  deposit(borrowlib)/function depositTokens(borrowing).

### Summary

 lastethprice is not updated function in  deposit(borrowlib)/function depositTokens(borrowing) but lastethprice is updated in the  function _withdraw(borrowing.sol). So if lastEthprice = 2000 usd, currentEthPrice = 2100 usd. Now  deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is called, omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue is increased/updated(so cds/borrow ratio is increased but lastethprice is not updated to 2100 ), after that, again deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is called and again omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue will be increased(so cds/borrow ratio will be increased ) but this time  omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue is 0, so cds/borrow ratio should be decreased. This is the way the cds/borrow ratio will be bigger than expected ratio because lastethprice is not updated in the deposit function. Similarly if currentethprice is less than lastethprice and   deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is called multiple times(without calling withdraw function(borrowlib)), then cds/borrow ratio will be less than expected ratio because lastethprice is not updated in the deposit function.In some cases , the cds/borrow’s real  ratio may become below 0.2 but the protocol will calculate above 0.2(so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2,
 

### Root Cause

lastethprice is not updated function deposit(borrowlib)/function depositTokens(borrowing) but lastethprice is updated in the  function _withdraw(borrowing.sol).

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, lastEthprice = 2000 usd, currentEthPrice = 2100 usd, current omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue = 500 usd, current omnichaindata.vaultValue = 2000, so cds/borrow ratio = 500/2000 = 0.25.totalCollateralInETH = 1 eth.

2. now deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is called with 100 usd worth of collateral, as currentEthPrice > lastEthprice , so netPLCdsPool(profit) = 1*100 = 100 usd. Now omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue = 500+100 = 600 usd and omnichaindata.vaultValue = 2000+100 = 2100 usd, so cds/borrow ratio = 600/2100 = 0.28.

3. see the deposit function(borrowlib.sol) where lastEthprice is not updated(so the lastEthprice is still 2000 but it should be 2100) but in the withdraw function(borrowlib.sol) lastethprice is updated.

4. after that, deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is again called with 100 usd worth of collateral(lastEthprice = 2000 usd, currentEthPrice = 2100 usd), currentEthPrice > lastEthprice , so netPLCdsPool(profit) = 1*100 = 100 usd. Now omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue = 600+100 = 700 usd and omnichaindata.vaultValue = 2100+100 = 2200 usd, so cds/borrow ratio = 700/2200 = 0.31. But here lastEthprice should be 2100, currentEthPrice = 2100, so  netPLCdsPool should be 0, omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue = 600+0 = 600, omnichaindata.vaultValue = 2100+100 = 2200 , so cds/borrow ratio should be = 600/2200 = 0.27.so here cds/borrow ratio should be decreased but it has increased which is incorrect.

5. if deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is again called(still withdraw is not called), it will again increase the cds/borrow ratio unfairly as lastethprice is not updated.

### Impact

if lastEthprice = 2000 usd, currentEthPrice = 2100 usd. Now  deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is called, omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue is increased/updated(so cds/borrow ratio is increased but lastethprice is not updated to 2100 ), after that, again deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is called and again omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue will be increased(so cds/borrow ratio will be increased ) but this time  omnichaindata.cdsPoolValue is 0, so cds/borrow ratio should be decreased. This is the way the cds/borrow ratio will be bigger than expected ratio because lastethprice is not updated in the deposit function. Similarly if currentethprice is less than lastethprice and   deposit function(borrowlib.sol) is called multiple times(without calling withdraw function(borrowlib)), then cds/borrow ratio will be less than expected ratio because lastethprice is not updated in the deposit function.In some cases , the cds/borrow’s real  ratio may become below 0.2 but the protocol will calculate above 0.2(so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2,

### Mitigation

update lastethprice in the function depositTokens(borrowing).
