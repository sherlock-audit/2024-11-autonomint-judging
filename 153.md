# Lack of Price Range(Min/Max) Validation for Chainlink Oracle(ETH/USD) in Optimism Chain

### Summary

The `MasterPriceOracle` contract does not verify the validity of price data from Chainlink oracles by checking against defined minimum and maximum price thresholds. This oversight can lead to financial discrepancies during volatile market conditions.



### Root Cause

According to the following [Sherlock guideline ](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#viii.-list-of-issue-categories-that-are-considered-valid) min/max checks are valid for specific feeds.
> ### VIII. List of Issue categories that are considered valid:
>5. **Chainlink Price Checks:** Issues related to `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` checks on Chainlink's Price Feeds are considered medium **only** if the Watson explicitly mentions the price feeds (e.g. USDC/ETH) that require this check.

The following code in `MasterPriceOracle` contract use ETH/USD feed of Chainlink in Optimism

```solidity
        } else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
```

Please review the [ETH/USD oracle](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x13e3Ee699D1909E989722E753853AE30b17e08c5#readContract) and its [aggregator](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9#readContract), which returns a minimum answer (`1000000000`) and a maximum answer (`100000000000000`).

However, the code lacks a check to ensure that the returned answer falls within the range defined by the minimum and maximum values.‚Äù

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. A significant crash in the price of ETH is occured.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
If a crash in the price of ETH is occured, the following functions will be disrupted,

1. [`Borrowing.depositTokens()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L239):  Users can deposit tokens with higher exchange rate
2. [`Borrowing.withDraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L294):  Users will face significant loss if they withdrawing collaterals during this time

Similiarly, this make issues in deposits and yields calculations in `CDS` contract

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement validation checks for `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` when using Chainlink ETH/USD oracle in Optimism. Transactions should be restricted if the reported price hits these thresholds.
