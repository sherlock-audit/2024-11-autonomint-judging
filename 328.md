# Lack of Ether refund in _withdraw

### Summary

Missing refund ether in one case, users will lose some remaining Ether.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing:_withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L635), borrowers can withdraw their collateral.

The developers have already considered the refund of Ether case. If this borrow position does not have any downsideProtected, we will refund remaining `msg.value - fee.nativeFee` to the user. If the borrow position has some downsideProtected, the left Ether will be used as `feeForOFT`. Because we need to send another cross chain message to transfer some usda from the other chain to this chain.

The problem is that we may not need to send one cross chain message in `_getDownsideFromCDS()` function. If `getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() >= downsideProtected`, we will not send this cross-chain message. In this case, we fail to refund the remaining Ether to the user.
 
```solidity
        {if (result.downsideProtected > 0) {
            _getDownsideFromCDS(result.downsideProtected, msg.value - fee.nativeFee);
        } else {
            // Send the remaining ETH to Borrower
            (bool sent, ) = payable(toAddress).call{value: msg.value - fee.nativeFee}("");
            if (!sent) revert Borrow_TransferFailed();
        }
```
```solidity
    function _getDownsideFromCDS(
        uint128 downsideProtected,
        uint256 feeForOFT
    ) internal {
        if (cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount() < downsideProtected) {
            globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: feeForOFT}(
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
                IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),downsideProtected - cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount()),
                // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
                IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
                IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_WITHDRAW,
                msg.sender
            );
        } else {
            // updating downside protected from this chain in CDS
            cds.updateDownsideProtected(downsideProtected);
        }
```
