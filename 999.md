# Unintended Downside Protection Exploitation in Borrowing Withdrawal Mechanism

### Summary

A significant vulnerability exists in the protocol's downside protection mechanism where borrowers can receive protection benefits during withdrawal even after their options have expired. While the system is designed to provide downside protection for the initial 30-day maturity period in exchange for an option fee, the current implementation fails to properly validate the maturity timeline during withdrawals.

### Root Cause

No check implementation is done for checking if the borrower's `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp` time comes under maturity time from the current time (block.timestamp)
Even if the borrower has not even renewed options for more than 30 days maturity time then also he will get downside protection from the protocol, and that's the ISSUE as the 
protocol will have to take loss because user will pay back the protocol less debt amount than intended.

Calculation happening for borrower's downside protection (even if he is not in options maturity, because of lack of check):

```solidity
            uint128 downsideProtected = calculateDownsideProtected(
                depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, params.ethPrice, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit
            );
```

Total Debt Amount to pay back is getting subtracted with that calculated downside protection amount, and user is paying less than indended to protocol. Ultimatly here Protocol will suffer.

```solidity
depositDetail.totalDebtAmountPaid = borrowerDebt - downsideProtected;
``` 

### Internal pre-conditions

Downside protection is calculated to a positive number when the provided asset in eth price at the time of deposit was more than the price of current eth price.
ie. when the collateral price is fallen below.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

. Borrower initiates a loan position
2. Deliberately waits for an extended period (e.g., one year) without renewing options
3. Executes withdrawal after significant price movements
4. Receives unauthorized downside protection benefits
5. Repays reduced debt amount despite expired protection

### Impact

The vulnerability creates a substantial financial risk for the protocol as it allows borrowers to unfairly benefit from expired protection mechanisms. This results in:
- Unauthorized reduction in debt repayments
- Protocol financial losses
- Exploitation of price movements without valid option coverage

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement strict validation of option maturity during withdrawal:
- Add timestamp verification for `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp`
- Only apply downside protection for positions within valid maturity periods
- Require full debt repayment for expired options
