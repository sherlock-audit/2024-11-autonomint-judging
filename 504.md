# `executeSetterFunction()` lacks any type of access control

### Summary

`executeSetterFunction()` is being used to execute a function that needs approval from several or all owners in the protocol.

It is being used in functions such as - `borrowing::setLTV()`, `borrowing::setBondRatio()` and others in `borrowing.sol` and `CDS.sol`.

The issue is that there is no access control that limits invoking it only from those core contracts, giving it the possibility of a malicious setting up a bot that instantly calls `executeSetterFunction()` after seeing that it has gotten the approval threshold for a certain function.

### Root Cause

Lack of access control to certain contracts that actually call it, giving it the possibility that a malicious user sets up a bot that tracks when the required threshold from the different owners is met and instantly call it.

Note that the owners vote manually and then a certain admin calls the function.

What will happen is that when the threshold of approvals is met, the bot can instantly call `executeSetterFunction()` and block the invocation of a function that needs to be called.

The admin not knowing about the vulnerability will think that the threshold is not actually met, even though it was.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Owners vote for a certain function to be executed in `approveSetterFunction()`
2. Threshold is met and a bot instantly snipes and calls `executeSetterFunction()` directly with the function intended to be called by an admin, denying the admin of actually invoking the function

### Impact

Admin will not be able to invoke and call the function that was approved by the owners to be called which may be a crucial value such as the usda limit, the treasury address or the admin of the application and many others.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement an access control limiting the invocation of it only from the contracts it is being called and not by anyone
