An attacker or a group of attackers can create muliple small borrow positions by making deposits of extremely small amounts and getting minted an equivalent amount of usda tokens. This is possible because the protocol does not enforce a minimum deposit amount in `borrowing.sol::depositTokens` or a minimum usda mint amount that users must be minted, per deposit action.  

These positions becomes almost unliquidatable as the cost of liquidating them may far outweigh the amounts to be liquidated, leading to situations where protocol admin has to choose between liquidating these positions and losing funds(gas fees) or allowing accural of bad debt which can result in protocol insolvency/ general fund loss for all users in the protocol.
