# Attacker Can Exploit Logical Error to Gain Unauthorized Option Renewals in `BorrowLib.getOptionFeesToPay()`

### Summary

A logical error exists in the `BorrowLib.renewOptions()` function's check for whether a position has been withdrawn or liquidated while calculating option fee using `BorrowLib.getOptionFeesToPay()`. This error could allow operations on positions that should be considered closed.




### Root Cause

The issue is found in the following code snippet within the `getOptionFeesToPay()` function which is called by `renewOptions()`:

```solidity
            // check the position is not withdrew or liquidated
            if (depositDetail.withdrawed && depositDetail.liquidated)
                revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyWithdrewOrLiquidated();
```

The condition uses a logical `AND (&&)` to check if both withdrawed and liquidated are true. This means the revert will only occur if both conditions are true simultaneously.

A position should be considered closed if it is either withdrawn or liquidated, not necessarily both.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker has a position that is either withdrawn or liquidated (but not both).
2. The attacker calls the `renewOptions()` function on this position.
3. Due to the logical AND (&&) condition, the check allows the function to proceed because both withdrawed and liquidated are not true simultaneously.
4. The function proceeds to renew the options on the position, even though it should be considered closed.




### Impact

This issue will allow a user to renew the positions that are either withdrawn or liquidated but not both.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the condition to use a logical OR (||) to ensure the revert occurs if either condition is true

```diff
            // check the position is not withdrew or liquidated
-           if (depositDetail.withdrawed && depositDetail.liquidated)
+           if (depositDetail.withdrawed || depositDetail.liquidated)
                revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyWithdrewOrLiquidated();
```
