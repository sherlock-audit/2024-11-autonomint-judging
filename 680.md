# Misrouted cross chain message refund causes loss of funds and bricks liquidations

### Summary

When the price of ETH drops 20% or more from the time a borrower deposits collateral, the protocol will liquidate the borrower by calling `Borrowing::liquidate()` from the admin address:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L363-L367

When the `liquidationType` is type `ONE`, `BorrowLiquidation::liquidationType1()` calculates how much USDa to get from the other chain for the liquidation:
```solidity
uint256 liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain = BorrowLib.getLiquidationAmountProportions(
                liquidationAmountNeeded,
                cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount(),
                omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount - omniChainData.downsideProtected,
                cds.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount(),
                omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount
            );   
```

If the amount is 0, the protocol intends to return the msg.value sent to pay the fees associated with the cross chain message back to the admin. 

However, the `msg.value` is sent to the `user` being liquidated instead of to the admin address, so the admin address will lose these funds:

```solidity
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
@>          (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```

A malicious user could also borrow using a smart contract address with a fallback that reverts any calls coming from the borrowing contract when the price of ETH drops more than 20% from deposit (bricking the protocol from liquidating the position). The user could wait for the price of ETH to come back to within the 20% number and then withdraw to an EOA they own since `Borrowing::withDraw` only checks that the `toAddress` is not a smart contract, and not `msg.sender`.
```solidity
function withDraw(
@>      address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {

@>      if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);
...
```

### Root Cause

msg.value refund for the cross chain message is returned to the user being liquidated instead of the admin address.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A borrower deposits collateral and the ETH price is $3000.
2. The price of ETH drops 

### External pre-conditions

1. The price of ETH drops more than 20% from the time a borrower deposits their collateral

### Attack Path

1. A borrower deposits collateral and the ETH price is $3000 at the time of deposit.
2. The price of ETH drops 20% to $2400, so the protocol calls `Borrowing::liquidate()` passing in `ONE` as the `liquidationType` to liquidate the borrower.
3. If `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` is 0, the protocol intends to send the msg.value amount back to the admin address, but instead sends it to the user being liquidated.  These funds are lost to the user.
4. A malicious user could also have deposited their collateral via a smart contract that contains a fallback function that reverts when the price of ETH drops 20% or more, bricking the protocols ability to liquidate the user.

### Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol and bad debt if the user can't be liquidated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Send the refund for the cross chain message back to the admin address, not the user.
