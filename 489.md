# Missing underflow check will prevent legitimate users from withdrawing their CDS positions


### Summary

A missing underflow check in `cdsAmountToReturn()` calculation will cause reverts when withdrawing CDS positions, preventing legitimate users from accessing their funds when `valDiff` is less than `excessProfitCumulativeValue`

### Root Cause

In CDS.sol#withdraw() [L343](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L343) and CDS.sol#cdsAmountToReturn() [L442-498](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L442-L498), the calculation `valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue` can underflow when `valDiff < excessProfitCumulativeValue`, causing the entire withdrawal transaction to revert.

```solidity
uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn(
    msg.sender,
    index,
    omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
    omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
    excessProfitCumulativeValue
) - 1; //? subtracted extra 1 wei
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User attempts to withdraw from a CDS position where `valDiff` < `excessProfitCumulativeValue`

### Impact

Legitimate users are unable to withdraw their CDS positions when the value difference is less than the excess profit cumulative value, requiring them to request new signatures from the protocol to complete withdrawals.

### Mitigation

Add underflow protection checks in `cdsAmountToReturn()`:

```solidity
// In profit calculation sections
--- uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;
+++ uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff >= excessProfitCumulativeValue ? (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue) : 0)) / 1e11;
```

This needs to be applied to all three locations where profit is calculated in the function.
