# There will be problem when upgrading `MasterPriceOracle` as it inherits from `Initializable`

### Summary

There will be a problem when upgrading `MasterPriceOracle`. This contract inherits from `Initializable`, which is designed for use with upgradeable contracts.
It should have `initialize` function. Also should inherit  `OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable`

### Impact

If you attempt to upgrade this contract, the constructor will be called again during the upgrade process. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as re-initializing variables, overwriting existing data, and breaking the contract's functionality.

### PoC

[Inheriting Initializable from openzeppelin's contracts-upgradeable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L17)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol"; <@

import {BasePriceOracle} from "./BasePriceOracle.sol";
import {IRedstoneOracle} from "./defaultOracles/IRedSToneOracle.sol";
import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
import {IBorrowing} from "../interface/IBorrowing.sol";
import "hardhat/console.sol";

/**
 * @title MasterPriceOracle
 * @notice Use a combination of price oracles.
 * @dev Implements `PriceOracle`.
 */
contract MasterPriceOracle is Initializable, BasePriceOracle { <@
    ...OTHER_CODES...
}
```

### Mitigation

create `initialize` a function

```solidity
    function initialize(
        address[] memory underlyings,
        address[] memory _oracles
    ) public initializer {
        // ... (rest of the constructor logic)
    }
```

on the `constructor` it is best practice to call `_disableInitializers()`

```solidity
constructor() {
  _disableInitializers(); <@
}
```

Also inherit ` OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable`
