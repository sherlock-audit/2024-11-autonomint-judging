# Borrowers can renew expired options before withdrawal

### Summary

When borrowers deposit collateral, they also purchase a call options that gives them price exposure to ETH price increases above a certain strike price.

Borrowers can renew their call option anytime 15 to 30 days after purchase via the `Borrowing::renewOptions()` function.

`Borrowing::renewOptions()` calls `BorrowLib::RenewOptions()`, which calls BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay() to calculate the amount the user will need to pay to renew the option:

```solidity
 function renewOptions(
        IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint64 index
    ) external returns (bool) {
        
          // calculate options fees needs to pay to renew
@>    uint256 optionsFeesNeedsToPay = getOptionFeesToPay(interfaces.treasury,index);

...
```
In `BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay()`, there's a check to ensure the borrower is eligible to renew their options:

```solidity
function getOptionFeesToPay(
        ITreasury treasury,
        uint64 index
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        
...

            // check the user is eligible to renew position
            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
                block.timestamp >
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();

...
```

The problem is that the if statement criteria is impossible.

The `block.timestamp` cannot both be less than `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days` and greater than `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days`.

This allows borrowers to renew options that should be ineligible for renewal. Since dCDS depositors are technically the option sellers, these users end up losing funds to this issue by having to pay out ETH upside for options that should be expired.

NOTE:  The protocol has a separate issue enabling borrowers to purchase options that never expire (See the finding titled: "Lack of check allows borrowers to purchase options that never expire"). This issue assumes that issue is corrected because there's no point in renewing an option that never expires. 

### Root Cause

Criteria in IF statement makes revert impossible.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The dCDS pool is at least 20% of the collateral vault, otherwise, borrowing is disabled
2. A borrower depositsCollateral, purchasing a call option

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

Here's a scenario where a borrower can take advantage of being able to renew their options anytime they want:

1. A borrower calls `Borrowing::depositTokens`, purchasing a call option
2. The borrowers call option expires (after 30 days) before the price of ETH increases above their strike price.
3. 45 days after purchasing the call option, the price of ETH increases above their strike price. The borrower calls `Borrowing::renewOptions` before withdrawing their collateral enabling them to realize gains from the  price of ETH increasing.

### Impact

Loss of funds for dCDS depositors because borrowers can now steal the `currentETHPrice - strikePrice` upside that should belong to dCDS depositors by renewing expired options before withdrawal.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `&&` should be an `||`:

```diff
           if (
                block.timestamp <
-                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
+                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
                block.timestamp >
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
