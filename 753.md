# Lack of access control for the `contractBurnFrom` function

### Summary

All the public functions in the USDa.sol contract has modifiers that restrict who can call the functions, things like burn and `contractTransferFrom` have the onlyCoreContract modifier that restricts it to only be called by the core contract, but the `contractBurnFrom` has no modifier and it is not restricted and anyone can call it.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the lack of access control here.

```solidity
  function contractBurnFrom(
        address owner,
        uint256 amount
    ) public returns (bool) {
        uint256 currentAllowance = contractAllowances[owner][msg.sender];
        if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {
            if (currentAllowance < amount) revert ERC20InsufficientAllowance(msg.sender, currentAllowance, amount);
            _contractApprove(owner, msg.sender, currentAllowance - amount);
            _burn(owner, amount);
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
```

### Impact

Anyone who has approval would be able to burn from the contract that is not by design.
