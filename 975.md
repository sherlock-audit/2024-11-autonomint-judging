# `cdsAmountToReturn` has been implemented incorrectly, causing incorrect withdrawals

### Summary

When depositors withdraw through CDS the number of assets that they should receive is calculated through the `cdsAmountToReturn` function. The function accounts for any profits or losses of the deposit based on the cumulative value at the time of the deposit and at the time of the withdrawal. The issue is that it currently calculates the profits/losses incorrectly, causing wrong withdrawals.

### Root Cause

In CDS.cdsAmountToReturn the difference between the cumulative values at the times of the deposit and withdrawal is deducted/added to the deposit amount in the term of a loss or a profit. This is how the calculation is performed:

```solidity
 if (cumulativeValueAtDeposit > cumulativeValueAtWithdraw) {
                valDiff = cumulativeValueAtDeposit - cumulativeValueAtWithdraw;
            } else {
                valDiff = cumulativeValueAtWithdraw - cumulativeValueAtDeposit;
            }
            // If cumulative value sign at the time of deposit is positive
            if (cumulativeValueSignAtDeposit) {
                if (cumulativeValueAtDeposit > cumulativeValueAtWithdraw) {
                    // Its loss since cumulative val is low
                    uint256 loss = (depositedAmount * valDiff) / 1e11;
                    return (depositedAmount - loss);
                } else {
                    // Its gain since cumulative val is high
                    uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;
                    return (depositedAmount + profit);
                }
            } 
```

As we can see the `valDiff` is multiplied by the deposit amount and scaled down. After that it is either added to the deposited amount or deducted. The cumulative value represents the ratio of the borrowing vault balance, denominated into USD, and the total CDS deposited amount:

Therefore, by multiplying the deposited USD by `valDiff` we would receive a portion of the borrowing vault balance, denominated in USD, that the deposited amount is worth. Thus, it is incorrect to reduce/increase the deposited amount by its value in terms of the borrowing vault as these are two completely different units. As a result, the deposited amount will be calculated incorrectly and will be higher/lower than it should depending on whether there profits or losses have accumulated.

Furthermore, as the units are different, it is possible for the losses to be more than the deposited amount causing an underflow.

### Attack Path

1. A user withdraws their deposit from CDS.
2. The cumulative value has decreased since the time of the deposit and losses have accumulated.
3. As the losses are denominated in terms of the deposit's vault balance value, they are able to become higher than the deposit amount itself, preventing the user from withdrawing.

### Impact

Incorrect profit/loss calculations will cause users to receive an incorrect number of assets when withdrawing from CDS.
