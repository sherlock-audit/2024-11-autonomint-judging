# Late abond holders steal USDa amount from liquidations from earlier abond holders

### Summary

`BorrowLib::redeemYields()` [gets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L996) `usdaToAbondRatioLiq`, which is the amount of USDa gained from liquidations pro-rata to the total supply of abond, at current value without consideration from previous depositors. This means that if some user holds abond and a liquidation happens, other users can mint abond to steal yield from past liquidations.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib.sol:1002`, there is no consideration from past/next abond holders.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits and withdraws from `borrowing.sol`, minting abond tokens.
2. User is liquidated via `borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1()`, adding USDa from liquidation.
3. Another user can deposit and withdraw from `borrowing.sol` and steal these USDa, even using a flashloan if necessary.

### Impact

Abond holders suffer losses.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Add a cumulative tracking variable to handle this case.
