# Denial-of-Service Risk in Liquidation Type 1 Due to Exchange Rate Underflow

### Summary
The `liquidationType1` process is vulnerable to an underflow revert Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Specifically, the calculation of `yields` can cause an underflow when the current `exchangeRate` is lower than the exchange rate of the borrower's asset at the time of deposit. This can lead to repeated reverts, preventing the admin from liquidating the borrower's position, which may result in a prolonged DoS scenario.

### Root Cause
The vulnerability stems from the subtraction operation in the yields calculation, which will trigger a revert when the current exchangeRate is lower than the exchange rate of the borrower's asset at the time of their deposit.

Note: Liquidations are only triggered when the current asset price falls below the price at the time of the deposit by a factor of 0.8. In other words, the current Asset/ETH exchange rate must have dropped from the rate at the time the borrower made their deposit.

Flow Breakdown
The current exchangeRate is calculated within the liquidationType1 function:

[Code Reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L187)

```solidity
(uint128 exchangeRate, /*uint128 ethPrice*/ ) =
borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));
```
The yields are then calculated in the following line, where an underflow will occur if the current exchangeRate is lower than the rate at the time of deposit:

[Code Reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L265)

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```
The value of depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH was originally calculated based on the exchange rate at the time of deposit. This can be traced back to the following calculation:

[Code Reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L655)

```solidity
params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;
```
The value of depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH is set based on the exchange rate at that time, meaning it was larger than the current exchange rate when a liquidation is triggered.

Therefore, when the yields are calculated, the value of `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)` will be larger than `depositDetail.depositedAmount,` resulting in an underflow during the subtraction.

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```
This leads to an underflow revert since the right-hand side of the subtraction is larger than the left-hand side.
### Internal Pre-conditions
This vulnerability occurs when the current `exchangeRate` is less than the exchange rate of the borrower's asset at the time of their deposit.

### External Pre-conditions
None

### Attack Path

Here’s an example of how the underflow occurs in the `yields` calculation:

1. Suppose the values are as follows:

   ```solidity
   depositDetail.depositedAmount = 1e18;
   depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH = 1.02e18;
   exchangeRate = 1.01e18;
   ```

2. The `yields` calculation:

   ```solidity
   uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
   ```

   Calculation:

   ```solidity
   1e18 - ((1.02e18 * 1e18) / 1.01e18) => Underflow REVERT.
   ```

   The result of this calculation will cause an underflow due to the larger value on the right-hand side of the subtraction.

### Impact

- The admin will not be able to perform the liquidation via `liquidationType1`, even when the borrower's position is unhealthy.
- This can result in an accumulation of bad debt within the protocol, impacting financial stability.
- Borrowers who deposited at more favorable exchange rates could gain an unfair advantage as the liquidation process becomes unavailable.
- Potential financial losses for the protocol and CDS participants, as liquidations are a source of profit for them.

### PoC

No proof of concept provided.

### Mitigation
The fix for this vulnerability is non-trivial, and it involves ensuring that the subtraction operation in the `yields` calculation does not lead to underflow. One possible solution is to add additional checks to verify that the `exchangeRate` is not lower than the deposit’s original exchange rate before performing the subtraction.
