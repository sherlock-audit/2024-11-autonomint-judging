# Incorrect `lastEventTime` Update in `_withdraw` Leading to Miscalculation of Cumulative Rate and Undercharged Debt

### Summary

The `calculateCumulativeRate` function in the BorrowLib library is being invoked with an incorrect `lastEventTime`, leading to erroneous calculations of the cumulative rate, which is then assigned to the `lastCumulativeRate`. As a result, borrowers are undercharged, causing financial losses to the protocol.

### Root Cause

In the `borrowing::_withdraw` function, the following line [lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L701) updates `lastEventTime` to the current block timestamp before the `calculateCumulativeRate` function is called [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L704). This sequence results in incorrect calculations in `calculateCumulativeRate`.

The flow after this is as follows:

In the `borrowing::calculateCumulativeRate` function:

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Retrieve the number of borrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Invoke the calculateCumulativeRate function in BorrowLib
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,  // lastEventTime is incorrectly updated
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

In the `BorrowLib::calculateCumulativeRate` function, the line:

```solidity
    uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
```

**Will result in `timeInterval = 0** because `lastEventTime` was updated earlier to `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        // If there are no borrowers, the current cumulative rate is the same as ratePerSec
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Calculate the time interval between the last event and the current block timestamp
            uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;  // Incorrect value due to above update
            
            // Calculate the cumulative rate using the time interval
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

This results in the `currentCumulativeRate` being incorrectly calculated as a smaller value, which is then assigned to the `lastCumulativeRate` in [borrowing.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L540). As a result, the `lastCumulativeRate` used in future calculations will always be lower than intended, impacting subsequent calculations.

### Impact

- Borrowers will consistently pay less debt than expected because the `lastCumulativeRate` will always be set to a lower value, which will be used for calculating debt.
- The protocol will suffer financial losses as the amount of debt collected from borrowers will be less than intended.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower initiates a withdrawal (`_withdraw` function).
2. The `lastEventTime` is incorrectly updated before the `calculateCumulativeRate` function is invoked.
3. The cumulative rate calculation uses the incorrect `lastEventTime`, resulting in a smaller rate.
4. The undercharged debt is recorded in the protocol, leading to financial loss.

### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, the `lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);` line should be moved to after the call to `calculateCumulativeRate()`, similar to the approach used in the `borrowing::depositToken` function.
