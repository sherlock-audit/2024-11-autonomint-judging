# Hardcoding the deposit amount to 1000 for rewards calculation which makes it vulnerable to sybil attacks.

### Summary
Hardcoding the deposit amount in the calculation of the `cumulativeValue` in `CDSLib.sol` to `1000` would give an unfair advantage to someone who deposits less while receiving the same amount of rewards as someone who deposits more. This also enables Sybil attacks.

### Root Cause
Hardcoding the deposited amount to `1000` USD for the reward mechanism is critical, as it allows for Sybil attacks and unfair distribution of rewards.

The function `calculateCumulativeValue()` in `CDSLib.sol` is used when withdrawing and depositing in CDS, as well as in the Borrowing contract:

    }

### Attack Path
- An attacker could create multiple deposits to gain a larger share of the rewards.
- The attacker could make minimal deposit amounts and perform as many deposits as possible.

### Impact
Attackers could extract the majority of rewards, or all rewards would be distributed unfairly, as each deposit's cumulative value for reward distribution is calculated based on a fixed amount of 1000 instead of the actual deposited amount.

### Mitigation
There are effective ways to track rewards for many users. Consider implementing the rewardDebt logic from MasterChef contracts.
