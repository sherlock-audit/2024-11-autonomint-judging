# Interest rate accrued from liquidation of debt can't be withdrawn

### Summary

When liquidating, the protocol calculates the interest rate up until the time of liquidation and sends it [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L272).

We correctly add that value, but the issue is that we can't actually withdraw it, because there is no function implemented for withdrawing interest rate accrued in the liquidation process, as well as causing some of the interest accrued from repaying the loan to be stucked in the [require statement here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L621).

### Root Cause

The root cause is the lack of a function implemented for withdrawing `totalInterestFromLiquidation` in `Treasury.sol`, causing it to be forever stuck.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin liquidates loans as time goes on and on due to them falling below the `8000` threshold.
2. Admin decides to withdraw the interest that's accrued in the variable `totalInterestFromLiquidation`, but there is no such function implemented for withdrawing interest.

### Impact

The interest accrued from the loans that are liquidated is going to be unclaimable forever with no way of them being retrieved, as well as causing some interest rate from repaying the loan to be stucked in `Treasury::withdrawInterest()` due to the require statement on line 621

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a function that can withdraw the interest accrued in the liquidation process.
