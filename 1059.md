# Missing Heartbeat Interval and Zero-Price Checks in Chainlink Oracle Implementation in `MasterPriceOracle`

### Summary

The protocol relies on Chainlink Oracles to fetch prices for underlying assets and ETH on the Optimism network. However, the implementation is missing crucial safety checks, such as verifying the heartbeat interval and ensuring the fetched prices are greater than zero. Without these checks, stale or zero prices can be accepted from the oracle. This oversight can result in incorrect price calculations and potential financial losses for the protocol and its users. 

The absence of checks for the heartbeat interval and price validation (>0) in the Chainlink Oracle integration allows stale or incorrect prices to be used in calculations.


### Root Cause

The absence of checks for the heartbeat interval and price validation (>0) in the Chainlink Oracle integration allows stale or incorrect prices to be used in calculations.

as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L80C13-L91C61).

```solidity
 AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
            (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. The Chainlink Oracle returns a stale price due to network issues or delayed updates, and the protocol does not validate the price's freshness.  
2. The protocol accepts a price of `0` from the oracle, allowing stale or zero prices to be used in operations, which can lead to exploitation or incorrect financial outcomes.

### Impact

- **Financial Loss**: The protocol may perform incorrect operations based on stale or zero prices, resulting in fund mismanagement or unintended payouts.  
- **Exploitation Risk**: Attackers could exploit stale or zero prices for financial manipulation of the protocol.  



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that the protocol checks the heartbeat interval against the last updated timestamp and verifies that the prices from the oracle are greater than zero.
