# Wrong calculation of cdsVaultValue/collateralVault ratio at `BorrowLib::calculateRatio`, breaking the core system invariants and resulting in significant losses to the protocolâ€™s USDa pool reserves

## Summary

`BorrowLib::calculateRatio` will calculate the ratio of dCDS Pooled Value/ ETH Vault. This vaule should >= 0.2 for 20% downside protection.
However, when calculating the value of `currentCDSPoolValue`, the developers did not subtract the value of `downsideProtected` . This would potentially cause the final computed ratio to be larger than the actual ratio, breaking the the core system invariants:

> New Borrows cannot mint new stablecoin if cds/borrow ratio is below 0.2 and cds users cannot withdraw. This might have a user experience issue.

## Vulnerability Details

As you can see in the [relevant code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L201-L214),When `noOfDeposits > 0`, the calculation of `currentCDSPoolValue` traces back to `previousData.cdsPoolValue`, which actually points to `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue`. This value is updated during CDS user deposits or withdrawals, and as you can see, it does not account for the influence of `omniChainData.downsideProtected`.

By contrast, when `noOfDeposits = 0`, `currentCDSPoolValue` is derived from `latestTotalCDSPool`, calculated as `(omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount - omniChainData.downsideProtected)`. Under this condition, the influence of `omniChainData.downsideProtected` is considered.

However, as you can see, the scenario where `noOfDeposits > 0` represents the vast majority of cases.

## Attack path
- The attacker, acting as a stablecoin borrower, initiates multiple USDa stablecoin loans by collateralizing ETH.
- Simultaneously, the attacker also acts as a CDS user, depositing USDa to provide downside price protection for borrowers while earning corresponding fee rewards.
- When the conditions for the attacker to withdraw USDa as a CDS user are met, the attacker strategically chooses to act during periods of significant price drops in the collateralized token. As a stablecoin borrower from step one, the attacker repays the stablecoins to redeem the collateral. This operation significantly increases omniChainData.downsideProtected, ultimately causing the calculated cds/borrow ratio to be larger than its actual value (because the numerator in the ratio calculation does not subtract downsideProtected).

## Impact

This scenario is likely to occur under edge conditions, where the actual cds/borrow ratio falls below 20%. However, due to the miscalculation, the final ratio exceeds 20%, enabling the attacker to maliciously withdraw stablecoins.

## Recommended mitigation

Correctly update `currentCDSPoolValue` when `noOfDeposits >` 0 at `BorrowLib::calculateRatio`

```diff
 function calculateRatio(
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 currentEthPrice,
        uint128 lastEthprice,
        uint256 noOfDeposits,
        uint256 totalCollateralInETH,
        uint256 latestTotalCDSPool,
        IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory previousData
    ) public pure returns (uint64, IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory) {
        ...
        } else {
            // find current vault value by adding current depositing amount
            currentVaultValue =
                previousData.vaultValue +
                (amount * currentEthPrice);
            previousData.vaultValue = currentVaultValue;
            if (currentEthPrice >= lastEthprice) {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue += netPLCdsPool;
            } else {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue -= netPLCdsPool;
            }
            previousData.totalCDSPool = latestTotalCDSPool;
+           currentCDSPoolValue -= previousData.downsideProtected
            currentCDSPoolValue = previousData.cdsPoolValue * USDA_PRECISION;
        }
        ...
    }
```
