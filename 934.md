# Protocol will lose funds when user withdraw with borrowing health in range of 8 001 to 9 999

### Summary

Protocol operate with amount of collateral by adjusting any erc20 type of eth to native eth amount with exchange rate --> since rate of erc20/eth mostly greater then 1, while withdraw process protocol adjusting erc20 collateral back with decrementing extra amount of eth and sending initial collateral back to user
This adjustment handled by Treasury.sol withdraw()
```solidity
uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
            uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate; 
            // Transfer collateral to user
            bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
```
The issue caused by calculation inside BorrowLib.sol: calculateCollateralToReturn() 
```solidity
else if (
            8000 < params.borrowingHealth && params.borrowingHealth < 10000
        ) {
            collateralToReturn = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH;
        } else {
            revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();
        }
        // Calculate the 50% of colllateral to return

        collateralToReturn = calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) - collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
```
collateralRemainingInWithdraw will be 0 for this case, so we just return half of params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH as amount

Therefore, in case user have health in range between 8 001 and 9 999 the upsides we expected to deduct in withdraw() from treasure contract will be 0 and user will withdraw MORE amount of erc20 tokens he deposited (as you can see, upsides won't be deducted)

### Root Cause

Treasury.sol withdraw()
```solidity
uint256 upside = ((depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH * 50) / 100) - amount;
            uint256 upsideToDeduct = (upside * 1 ether) / exchangeRate; 
            // Transfer collateral to user
            bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
```
BorrowLib.sol: calculateCollateralToReturn() 
```solidity
else if (
            8000 < params.borrowingHealth && params.borrowingHealth < 10000
        ) {
            collateralToReturn = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH;
        } else {
            revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();
        }
        // Calculate the 50% of colllateral to return

        collateralToReturn = calculateHalfValue(params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) - collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

borrower's health should be in rage of 8 001 to 9 999

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

 1) Attacker borrow funds and put erc20 eth collateral with price more then eth
2)Attacker withdraw funds when his health less then 9 999 but more then 8000
3)protocol loose funds since he sending him not adjusted down amount of erc20

### Impact

Protocol loosing funds

### PoC

### Mitigation
