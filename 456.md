# users can pass arbitrary strike price as parameter to Borrowing::depositTokens

### Summary

users can pass arbitrary strike price as parameter to `Borrowing::depositTokens`

### Root Cause

there isn't any relation between strike price and strike precent and this causes malicious actor purchase call option with desire strike price

### PoC
A lower strike price (closer to or below the current market price) generally means a higher premium because the option is more likely to be exercised profitably (i.e., "in the money").
A higher strike price (above the market price) usually results in a lower premium as the likelihood of the option expiring profitably decreases

When borrowHealth is lower than 100% then the user gets full collateral i.e. 0.5 ETH initially and the rest (0.5ETH + yields) on  ABOND redemption

When borrowHealth is >100% then the borrower will get less collateral as (0-5)% of the price gains in ETH value will go to the dCDS user, hence malicious can decrease CDS depositors' profit with pass arbitrary amount as a strike price

### Impact
loss of funds for protocol and CDS depositors 

### Mitigation

consider to compute strike price based on stake precent
