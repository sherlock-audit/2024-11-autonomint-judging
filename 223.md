# Unbound for loop in `CDSLib::withdrawUser` will lock funds in CDS

### Summary

`CDSLib::withdrawUser` will lead to permanent DoS when there are too many noOfliquidations, which are incremented in the liquidate function in `borrowLiquidation::liquidateType1`. The incrementation of noOfLiquidations happen when a liquidation type 1 occurs, so noOfLiquidations will eventually become too high and the CDSLib::withdrawUser will become too exepensive to execute.

[noOfLiquidations incremented in borrowLiquidation::liquidateType1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L199)

### Root Cause

The for loop in `withdrawUser` will iterate through as many times as noOfLiquidations, which are incremented for each liquidation type 1.

### Internal pre-conditions

- High amount of liquidations `liquidateType1`
- User withdraws from CDS

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. High amount of liquidations of type 1
2. User withdraws from CDS
3. CDSLib::withdrawUser for loop iterates through with noOfLiquidations as the amount of times to iterate
4. CDSLib::withdrawUser becomes too expensive to execute
5. User can not withdraw from CDS

### Impact

Happens naturally overtime with a high amount of liquidations type 1. A user will not be able to withdraw from CDS since the function will become too expensive to execute. Permanent DoS for the `CDS::withdraw` function.

### PoC

Can not be created since the `borrowLiquidation::liquidateType1` function always reverts in underflow due to a bug I already reported. PoC would require altering the original code.

### Mitigation

Set a limit to the amount of noOfLiquidations that can be iterated through in `CDSLib::withdrawUser`
