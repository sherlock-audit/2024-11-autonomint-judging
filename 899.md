It handles the option as valid regardless of the expiration date.
Also, `optionsRenewedTimeStamp` isn't being updated when making a deposit either.




### Root Cause

```solidity
            // calculate time difference from deposit to current time
            uint256 secondsPassedSinceDeposit = block.timestamp - depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp;
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update option expiration date in deposit and withdraw.
Also, you need to add code in the withdraw function to handle some cases based on the expiration date.
