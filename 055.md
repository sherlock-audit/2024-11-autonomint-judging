# Locking period set by user does not have minimum of 1 month being enforced.

### Summary
The lock-in period option set during deposit, for dCDS user, is not sanitized if it's more than 30 days/more than the `withdrawTimeLimit`

### Root Cause
As can be seen from the docs https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/blockchain-docs/core-contracts/cds#deposit
and the deposit function there is a param called lockingPeriod, which the user can use to specify/make a longer locking period, with a minimum of 1 month by requirement.
```solidity
function deposit(
        uint128 usdtAmount,
        uint128 usdaAmount,
        bool liquidate,
        uint128 liquidationAmount,
        uint128 lockingPeriod ) payable 
```
> lockingPeriod | uint128 | How long the user is willing to stay deposited in the protocol.
However currently when its set during deposit in [CDSLib.sol#L534](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L534) is not being sanitized if its more than 30 days or the `withdrawTimeLimit` admin-set value.

This could also be seen from the frontend docs, that a longer locking period could be specified, but not less than 1 month:
https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/guides/how-to/dcds-interface
> Users can enter the "AMINT" amount to deposit and the time duration for which this AMINT will be locked in. The minimum time duration is 1 month 

### Flow of issue
1. A User wants to make a deposit.
2. Since the value is not sanitized, even though he could set it to less than 30 days, the TX will pass.
3. This would confuse the user, as later on, he won't be able to withdraw earlier due to the `withdrawTimeLimit` check in the withdraw function.

### Impact
There is a separate issue, that this value is not enforced during withdrawal, which it should be. However, fixing it, won't fix this one here.
Even if we add both checks, for lockingperiod and keep the one for `withdrawTimeLimit`, which is currently present:
```solidity
     if (cdsDepositDetails.depositedTime + withdrawTimeLimit > uint64(block.timestamp)) {
            revert CDS_WithdrawTimeNotYetReached();
        }
```
We would still allow users to set a lower value for lockingperiod than 30 days, which will never be checked during deposit and will trick users into believing they could withdraw their funds earlier.

### Mitigation
Check that the locking period is at least 30 days or `withdrawTimeLimit` if not, revert and don't allow a deposit.
