# Incorrect usdaToTransfer calculation when cds owners withdraw

### Summary

When cds owners withdraw their positions, we will split 10% possible profit to the protocol team. But the profit's calculation is incorrect. This will cause the distribution between cds owner and protocol team is incorrect.

### Root Cause

When cds owners withdraw their positions, we will check whether this position has some profit. If this cds position has some profit, we will split 10% to the protocol team. This 10% profit will be [deducted from the cds owner's return value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L891).

In calculateUserProportionInWithdraw function, we will calculate the diff between `depositedAmount` and `returnAmount` as the profit. But the problem is that here `depositedAmount` is not the original depositedAmount, it includes the [cumulative value gain/loss](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L351). The calculated profit is not the actual cds owner's profit.

For example:
1. Alice deposits 1000 USDA.
2. Alice withdraw her position, now her cds cumulative value is -100. The option fees is 100.
3. Actually there is no any profit for Alice's position. But `cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` = original deposit amount + gain/loss = 900, return value = 1000. The protocol think Alice has 100 USD profit. This is incorrect.
```solidity
    function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(
        CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
        params.usdaToTransfer = calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, params.returnAmount);
}
    function calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(
        uint256 depositedAmount,
        uint256 returnAmount
    ) public pure returns (uint128) {
        uint256 toUser;
        if (returnAmount > depositedAmount) {
            uint256 profit = returnAmount - depositedAmount;
            toUser = returnAmount - (profit * 10) / 100;
        } else {
            toUser = returnAmount;
        }
        return uint128(toUser);
    }
```
```solidity
        uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn(
            msg.sender,
            index,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
            excessProfitCumulativeValue
        ) - 1; //? subtracted extra 1 wei
        cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = currentValue;
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 1000 USDA.
2. Alice withdraw her position, now her cds cumulative value is -100. The option fees is 100.
3. Actually there is no any profit for Alice's position. But `cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` = original deposit amount + gain/loss = 900, return value = 1000. The protocol think Alice has 100 USD profit. This is incorrect.

### Impact

The profit's calculation is incorrect. This will cause the profit's distribution between cds owners and protocol team is incorrect.

### Mitigation

The profit should be `returnValue - original deposit amount`
