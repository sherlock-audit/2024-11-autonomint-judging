# `MasterPriceOracle` doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

### Summary

`MasterPriceOracle` doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer.


### Root Cause

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value, the price of the oracle will continue to return the `minAnswer` instead of the actual price of the asset. 

In [_price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L53C5-L96C6):
```solidity
function _price(
        address underlying
    ) internal view returns (uint128, uint128) {
        // if there is no oracles found revert
        if (oracles[underlying] == address(0))
            revert("Price oracle not found for this underlying token address.");

        // get oracles based on chain
        if(block.chainid == 31337 || block.chainid == 34443){ //?  31337 is used for testing
            // for we are using redstone oracles
            IRedstoneOracle oracle = IRedstoneOracle(oracles[underlying]);
            // updating the underlying to address supported by redstone, based on underlying type
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH]) {
                underlying = 0x028227c4dd1e5419d11Bb6fa6e661920c519D4F5;
            } else if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH]) {
                underlying = 0x4186BFC76E2E237523CBC30FD220FE055156b41F;
            } else if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                underlying = address(0);
            }

            // get the price of the underlying
            uint256 priceInUsd = oracle.priceOf(underlying);
            // get the eth price
            uint256 priceOfNativeInUsd = oracle.priceOfETH();
            // return the exchange rate of the underlying to the ETH and eth price
            return (uint128((priceInUsd * 1e18) / priceOfNativeInUsd), uint128(priceOfNativeInUsd / 1e16));
        } else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
@>        (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
            return (0, 0);
        }
    }
```
There is no check for the minAnswer/maxAnswer, even though the ETH/USD price feed requires it ([ref](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02f5E9e9dcc66ba6392f6904D5Fcf8625d9B19C9#readContract#F19)).



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The ETH experience huge price drop below the Aggregator's `minAnswer`
2. A user borrow assets, providing ETH as collateral
3. The user will receive more than he should 

### Impact

The issue arises when the actual price of an asset drastically changes but the oracle continues to operate using the `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer` as the asset's price. The users will be able to borrow against overpriced collateral in case of price dropping drastically.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the price is outside the minAnswer/maxAnswer of the oracle, the transaction should revert.
