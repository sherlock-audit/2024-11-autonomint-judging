# Transfers in `CDS.redeemUSDT()` will revert due to `.transferFrom()` usage not returning any value for USDT

### Summary

The use of transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom() in CDSLib.sol will cause all USDT redemptions to fail as USDT's non-standard implementation returns no value, which will cause the transaction check to revert.

### Root Cause

In [`CDSLib.sol:408`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L408-L412), the `redeemUSDT()` function uses unsafe USDT transfers:

```solidity
// Current implementation
bool success = interfaces.usdt.transferFrom(
    address(interfaces.treasury),
    msg.sender,
    usdtAmount
);
if (!success) revert CDSInterface.CDS_TransferFailed(IBorrowing.AssetName.TUSDT);
```

The issue is that USDT's transferFrom() doesn't return a boolean, making the success check always revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User attempts to redeem USDA for USDT
2. Contract has sufficient USDT balance

### Attack Path

1. User calls CDS.redeemUSDT()
2. Function attempts USDT transfer
3. Transfer executes but returns no value
4. Boolean check fails
5. Transaction reverts

### Impact

Users cannot redeem USDA for USDT as all redemption attempts will revert, effectively breaking a core protocol function.

### PoC

The function's failure path is described under the attack path.

### Mitigation

Replace current implementation with OpenZeppelin's `safeTransferFrom()`:

```solidity
import {SafeERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

// In contract:
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

// In redeemUSDT():
interfaces.usdt.safeTransferFrom(
    address(interfaces.treasury),
    msg.sender,
    usdtAmount
);
```

This handles non-standard ERC20 implementations safely.
