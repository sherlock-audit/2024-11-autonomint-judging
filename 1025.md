# The existing Oracle implementation does not include checks to validate whether the price falls within the specified `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer` limits.

### Summary

In the `depositTokens` function of the borrowing contract, the `getUSDValue` function is invoked to retrieve the price from the oracle
The getUSDValue function retrieves the price from the oracle. However, the price function within the oracle lacks checks to validate the minAnswer or maxAnswer values. This omission can lead to potential inaccuracies or vulnerabilities if the returned price falls outside acceptable bounds.

### Attack Path

Chainlink still maintains feeds that utilize `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` to restrict the range of price values. As a result, in the event of a price crash, an incorrect price could be used to value assets, creating an opportunity for users to exploit this inaccuracy. 

Here is the link to the ETH/USD oracle on the Optimism chain, which still employs `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`:

### Impact

In the event of a flash crash, the lack of proper validation for `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` can result in incorrect price values being used. This could lead to malicious outcomes, as attackers may exploit the inaccurate prices to manipulate asset valuations or execute profitable strategies at the expense of the protocol.

### Mitigation

If the price falls outside the `minPrice`/`maxPrice` range set by the oracle, a breaker should be activated to prevent further losses. This breaker would halt or limit transactions until the price returns within an acceptable range, ensuring that the protocol avoids using incorrect prices during volatile conditions like a flash crash.
