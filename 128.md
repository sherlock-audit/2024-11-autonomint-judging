# `calculateCumulativeRate` always returns `lastCumulativeRate` due to incorrect `lastEventTime` update

### Summary

In the `_withdraw` function, `lastEventTime` is updated to the current `block.timestamp` **before** calling the `calculateCumulativeRate` function. Since `calculateCumulativeRate` uses the updated `lastEventTime` to compute the time interval, the `timeInterval` value becomes `0`. This results in the cumulative rate calculation always returning `lastCumulativeRate` without accounting for elapsed time or interest rate changes.

### Root Cause

- `lastEventTime` is updated **before** calling `calculateCumulativeRate`, resulting in the time interval (`timeInterval`) being calculated as `0`.

- In `BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate`, the formula effectively becomes:  
  ```solidity
  currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * RATE_PRECISION / RATE_PRECISION;
  ```
  This always equals `lastCumulativeRate`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- The protocol fails to update the cumulative interest rate (`currentCumulativeRate`) correctly.  
- Borrowers and lenders are not charged or credited interest accurately, leading to financial discrepancies over time.  
- Protocol state becomes inconsistent, potentially exposing it to financial losses or exploitation.

### Mitigation

**Update `lastEventTime` After Calling `calculateCumulativeRate`**:  
   Move the `lastEventTime` update **after** the `calculateCumulativeRate` function call in the `_withdraw` function.

   ```solidity
   // Update cumulative rate first
   calculateCumulativeRate();
   // Then update the last event time
   lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);
   ```
