# Borrowing::withdraw will revert in underflow because of RATE_PRECISION value leading to locked user funds

### Summary

The `Borrowing::withdraw` function will always revert in an underflow because of the borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount calculation. The way borrowerDebt is calculated is from the BorrowLib::calculateDebtAmount function which calculates (amount * cumulativeRate) / RATE_PRECISION. Using an example of amount = 8.44e8 and cumulativeRate = 1.016e12 with the RATE_PRECISION always being 1e27, we can see that the borrowerDebt will always be smaller than the depositDetail.borrowedAmount since RATE_PRECISION is 1e27. The calculation would be (8.44e8 * 1.016e12) / 1e27, which would result in 0 since RATE_PRECISION is 1e27 and the result of the multiplication is 8.57e14, so divided by 1e27 results in 0. We know the calculation on line 881 of `BorrowLib.sol` is borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount, so it would be 0 - 8.44e8, which will revert in an underflow.

```javascript
                bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
@>                  (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral
                );
                if (!transfer) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_USDaTransferFailed();
```

[Subtraction that reverts in underflow on line 881 of `BorrowLib.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L881)

As seen in traces:
- borrowedAmount = 8.44e8
- 1.016e12 = cumulativeRate
- 1e27 = RATE_PRECISION
- 1.016e12 = cumulativeRate
- borrowerDebt = 0 since borrowerDebt = (8.44e8 * 1.016e12) / RATE_PRECISION

### Root Cause

The RATE_PRECISION value is set too high which will result in borrowerDebt being 0 meaning the borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount calculation will always revert in an underflow.

### Internal pre-conditions

- User deposits in Borrowing contract
- User withdraws from Borrowing contract

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User deposits in Borrowing contract
2. User attempts to withdraw from Borrowing contract to exit position
3. The transaction reverts on user with underflow/overflow EVM error
4. User funds are locked

### Impact

- User funds will be locked with no way for the user to retrieve their funds

### PoC

Insert the PoC in `borrowing.t.sol`
- Run the test with `forge test --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --mt testWithdrawInBorrowingAlwaysReverts -vvvv`

```javascript
function testWithdrawInBorrowingAlwaysReverts() public {

        uint256 usdtBalance = contractsA.usdt.balanceOf(address(USER));
        contractsA.usdt.approve(address(contractsA.cds),usdtBalance);

    }
```

### Mitigation

- Adjust the RATE_PRECISION variable to a lower value to prevent the underflow in `BorrowLib::withdraw`
