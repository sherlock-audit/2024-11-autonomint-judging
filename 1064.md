# `updateDownsideProtected` can be called by anyone leading to incorrect downside protection records on CDS module

### Summary

The function [`updateDownsideProtected`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829) can be called by anyone. It's supposed to be called only by the borrowing contract. As such, anyone can change the recorded value of `downsideProtected` inside the CDS contract, which can lead to incorrect downside protection value to be used on the borrowing contract.

```javascript

 function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount; // @audit anyone can call it to modify the downsideProtected value, any consequence?
    }
    
```

### Root Cause

The function updateDownsideProtected is publicly callable by anyone due to the `external` keyword.
