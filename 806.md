# `calculateRatio` does not account for all of the total CDS deposited, causing deposits to be bricked

### Summary

When users deposit into borrowing.sol `calculateRatio` is called to check whether the CDS has enough funds to give downside prortection to borrowers. The issue is that it currently does not account for the entire `totalCDSDepositedAmount`, causing the ratio to be lower than it actually should be. This is problematic as deposits may be bricked due to the incorrect ratio.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.calculateRatio here is how the ratio calculations are performed:
```solidity
        if (noOfDeposits == 0) {
            previousData.vaultValue = amount * currentEthPrice;
            currentVaultValue = previousData.vaultValue;
            previousData.totalCDSPool = latestTotalCDSPool;

            if (currentEthPrice >= lastEthprice) {
                currentCDSPoolValue = previousData.totalCDSPool + netPLCdsPool;
            } else {
                currentCDSPoolValue = previousData.totalCDSPool - netPLCdsPool;
            }

            previousData.cdsPoolValue = currentCDSPoolValue;
            currentCDSPoolValue = currentCDSPoolValue * USDA_PRECISION;
        } else {
            currentVaultValue = previousData.vaultValue + (amount * currentEthPrice);
            previousData.vaultValue = currentVaultValue;

            if (currentEthPrice >= lastEthprice) {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue += netPLCdsPool;
            } else {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue -= netPLCdsPool;
            }
            previousData.totalCDSPool = latestTotalCDSPool;
            currentCDSPoolValue = previousData.cdsPoolValue * USDA_PRECISION;
        }

        uint64 ratio = uint64((currentCDSPoolValue * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / currentVaultValue);
```

As we can see if it is the first deposit `currentCDSPoolValue` is set to the `totalCDSPool`, which is the `totalCDSDepositedAmount` +/- net profits/losses. However, when it is not the first deposit `currentCDSPoolValue` is only increased by the net profits/losses. Therefore, if more deposits have been made to CDS after the time when `calculateRatio` was firstly called, they will not be accounted for when the ratio is calculated. As a result, the ratio will be significantly lower than it actually should be, causing deposits to revert here:

### Attack Path

1. There are 1000 USDT deposited into CDS.
2. A user deposits into borrowing 1 ETH of assets.
3. Number of borrowers is zero so the `cdsPoolValue` is set to 1000.
4. After that more deposits have been made to CDS and the `totalCDSDeposited` is now 10000.
5. A user attempts to deposit a larget number ETH into borrowing, however, they cannot as the `cdsPoolValue` in `calculateRatio` is only updated by any net profits/losses, and the new deposits into CDS are not accounted for.
6. As a result, the returned value of `calculateRatio` is too low and the call reverts.

### Impact

Depositing into borrowing can be completely bricked.

### Mitigation

Always account the new CDS deposits when calculating the ratio.
