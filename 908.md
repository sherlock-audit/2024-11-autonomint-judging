# `Borrowing::_withdraw` updating `lastEventTime` even before calling `calculateCumulativeRate()` which will lead to incorrect calculations and update `lastCumulativeRate`

### Summary

The calculateCumulativeRate function in the BorrowLib library is being called with an incorrect lastEventTime, leading to miscalculations of the current cumulative rate that is later set to state variable `lastCumulativeRate`.

This results in undercharged debt for borrowers, causing financial losses to the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `borrowing::_withdraw` this line is [lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L701) is updating `lastEventTime` to the the current time, even before calling [calculateCumulativeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L704) this will cause incorrect calculations in function `calculateCumulativeRate` 

Here is the flow after that -> 

function [borrowing::calculateCumulativeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L530)

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
@>        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
// @audit issue block.timestamp
@->>        lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

Now in [BorrowLib::calculateCumulativeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L243) will `uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;` 
**will result to = 0** , because our `lastEventTime` was already updated to `block.timestamp`, as shown above.

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        // If there is no borrowers in the protocol
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            // current cumulative rate is same as ratePeSec
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Find time interval between last event and now
    
// @audit this will come 0        
@->>            uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            //calculate cumulative rate

// incorrect calculation due to above mistake
@->>            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

And this will negatively impact this calculation of `currentCumulativeRate` by giving a smaller value, which then will be updated in here in state variable of `borroing.sol` over here [lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L540) and a wrong value will be used for all other purposes of protocol calculations as well.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact


- from next time every borrower will pay less debt than intended because `lastCumulativeRate` state variable will always be calculated less than it should be, which later used in debt calculation. 

- loss to the protocol as they will get less debt fee than intended when the borrower will repay using `withdraw`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp); after `calculateCumulativeRate();` similar to it is done in `borrowing::depositToken` function.
