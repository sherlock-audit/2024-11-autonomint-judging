# Logical Vulnerability in deposit and withdraw Functions of Treasury contract that Allowing Manipulation of `noOfBorrowers` State

### Summary

The `treasury` contract contains a logical issue in the borrower count management mechanism. Specifically, the `noOfBorrowers` state variable is incremented when a user deposits for the first time but fails to increment properly if the user deposits again after withdrawing all collateral. This discrepancy allows a malicious user to repeatedly manipulate the `noOfBorrowers` variable, potentially reducing it to zero, which can freeze all withdrawals in the protocol.


### Root Cause


If a user deposits collateral in the borrowing contract, an external call is made to `interfaces.treasury.deposit` to update and transfer the collateral amount and the user's state.

When a user deposits tokens for the first time `!borrowing[user].hasDeposited`, the `++noOfBorrowers` is executed and increased by 1, and the `hasDeposited` flag is set to true, after that if the user deposits again, `++noOfBorrowers` is not executed since the `hasDeposited` flag is already true for this user only the borrowerIndex is incremented.


```solidity
    function deposit(
        address user,
        uint128 ethPrice,
        uint64 depositTime,
        IBorrowing.AssetName assetName,
        uint256 depositingAmount
    ) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (DepositResult memory) {
        uint64 borrowerIndex;
        //check if borrower is depositing for the first time or not
@>>        if (!borrowing[user].hasDeposited) {
            //change borrowerindex to 1
            borrowerIndex = borrowing[user].borrowerIndex = 1;

            //change hasDeposited bool to true after first deposit
            borrowing[user].hasDeposited = true;
@>>            ++noOfBorrowers;
        } else {
            //increment the borrowerIndex for each deposit
            borrowerIndex = ++borrowing[user].borrowerIndex;
        }
        //...
```



If a user withdraws their collateral from the borrowing contract, an external call is made to the treasury to withdraw the collateral, updating the state of the borrower. 

The logic in here is that if a borrower withdraws all their collateral `borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0`, the `--noOfBorrowers` is executed is decreased by 1.


```solidity
  function withdraw(
        address borrower,
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 index
    ) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (bool) {
        
        //...

        // if user has no deposited collaterals then decrement number of borrowers
@>>        if (borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0) {
@>>            --noOfBorrowers;
@>>        }
        borrowing[borrower].depositDetails[index] = depositDetails;
        // emit withdraw event
        emit Withdraw(toAddress, amount);
        return true;
    }

```

The problem here is in the logic of the code. It is implemented such that if `depositedAmountInETH == 0`, the value of `--noOfBorrowers` in the treasury contract is decreased. However, the issue arises when a user deposits again; `!borrowing[user].hasDeposited` will be true, and `++noOfBorrowers` will not be executed. Therefore, if this borrower withdraws their collateral again, `--noOfBorrowers` will be executed again.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. A malicious user deposits collateral for the first time, incrementing `noOfBorrowers`.
2. The user withdraws the entire collateral, decrementing `noOfBorrowers`.
3. The user deposits collateral again, bypassing the increment logic in the deposit function because `borrowing[user].hasDeposited` is true.
4. The user repeats steps 2 and 3 to progressively reduce `noOfBorrowers`.
5. Once `noOfBorrowers` reaches zero, withdrawals by other users are blocked as the protocol assumes no active borrowers remain.


### Impact

Block all withdrawals of the collateral from the treasury contract by setting `noOfBorrowers` to zero.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation



Add checks in the `withdraw` function to ensure consistent state management:

```diff
        //...

        depositDetails.depositedAmount = 0;
        depositDetails.depositedAmountInETH = 0;

        // if user has no deposited collaterals then decrement number of borrowers
-        if (borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0) {
-            --noOfBorrowers;
-        }

+        if (borrowing[borrower].depositedAmountInETH == 0 && borrowing[borrower].hasDeposited) {
+            --noOfBorrowers;
+            borrowing[borrower].hasDeposited = false;
+        }

        borrowing[borrower].depositDetails[index] = depositDetails;
        // emit withdraw event
        emit Withdraw(toAddress, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
