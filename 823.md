# `BorrowLib::redeemYields()` burns abond from `msg.sender` but calculates yield from `user`, leading to exploits

### Summary

`BorrowLib::redeemYields()` [burns](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1032) abond from `msg.sender`, but [withdraws](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1029) from external protocol the user argument.

This can be exploited by holding abond from one account that has collected some yield from ionic, and then depositing and withdrawing in borrowing to get more abond in another account that is used to call `borrowing::redeemYields()` and withdraw much more yield for the same abond tokens.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib:1032`, `msg.sender` is used instead of user.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Deposit and withdraw in `borrowing.sol`, getting abond tokens.
2. Let it generate some yield.
3. Deposit and withdraw in `borrowing.sol` with other accounts, getting abond tokens and calling `borrowing::redeemYields()` with these accounts, specifying the `user` as account 1, that has accumulated much more yield.

### Impact

Exploiter steals all protocol funds from ionic.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

`user` should always be `msg.sender`.
