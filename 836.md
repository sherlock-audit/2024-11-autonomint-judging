# `lastEventTime` is not updated during liquidation and withdrawal thus overinflating the `lastCumulativeRate`

### Summary

The `lastEventTime` is used to evaluate the `lastCumulativeRate` using the `calculateCumulativeRate()` function 


```solidity
File: borrowing.sol
363:     function liquidate(
364:         address user,
365:         uint64 index,
366:         IBorrowing.LiquidationType liquidationType
367:     ) external payable whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(2)) onlyAdmin {
368:         // Check whether the user address is non zero address
369:         if (user == address(0)) revert Borrow_MustBeNonZeroAddress(user);
370:         // Check whether the user address is admin address
371:         if (msg.sender == user) revert Borrow_CantLiquidateOwnAssets();
372: 
373:         // Call calculate cumulative rate fucntion to get interest
374:   @>    calculateCumulativeRate();
```

looking at the `calculateCumulativeRate()` implementation, 

```solidity
File: BorrowLib.sol
229:     function calculateCumulativeRate(

////         .................
241:         } else {
242:             // Find time interval between last event and now
243:    @>       uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
244:             //calculate cumulative rate
245:             currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
246:             currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
247:         }
248:         return currentCumulativeRate;
249:     }
```
Notice that the `currentCumulativeRate` which is also the `lastCumulativeRate` is calculated based on the `lastEventTime` however this value is not updated after liquidation and as such the next time `calculateCumulativeRate()` is called, it will be calculated based off of a stale value thus over-inflating the `lastCumulativeRate` because the  `timeInterval` on L243 is larger than it should be.


Any debt calculated base on this value will be overinflated as well.
```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
205:  @>     uint256 borrowerDebt = ((depositDetail.normalizedAmount * lastCumulativeRate) / BorrowLib.RATE_PRECISION);
206:         uint128 returnToTreasury = uint128(borrowerDebt);

```


### Root Cause

The problem is that the [`lastEventTime` is not updated during liquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L373-L375) leading to an overinflated debt calculation for a users position.


NOTE: the same problem exist during [withdraw for the borrowing contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L703-L704) and can have the same effect

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`lastCumulativeRate` is overinflated and as such user debt can be overinflated during liquidation.

There are other possible issues that can arise considering that this is a critical state variable in the protocol.

### Mitigation

Modify the `borrowing::liquidate()` function as shown below to prevent this issue

```diff
File: borrowing.sol
363:     function liquidate(
364:         address user,
365:         uint64 index,
366:         IBorrowing.LiquidationType liquidationType
367:     ) external payable whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(2)) onlyAdmin {
368:         // Check whether the user address is non zero address
369:         if (user == address(0)) revert Borrow_MustBeNonZeroAddress(user);
370:         // Check whether the user address is admin address
371:         if (msg.sender == user) revert Borrow_CantLiquidateOwnAssets();
372: 
373:         // Call calculate cumulative rate fucntion to get interest
374:         calculateCumulativeRate();
+373:        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);
