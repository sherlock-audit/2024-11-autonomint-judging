# Potential User Fund Locking Due To Unbounded Loop In Liquidation Withdrawal In `CDSLib.sol`

### Summary

In `CDSLib.sol:withdrawUser` contains an unbounded for loop which dynamically increase computation and gas cost for users with `liquidationIndexAtDeposit` greater than or equal to `params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` this will eventually cause a denial of service for users as the transaction will likely exceed the `blockgaslimit` consequently users will be unable to withdraw their funds.

### Root Cause

In `CDSLib:withdrawUser` there is an unbounded for-loop which iterates everytime a user withdraws and this subsequently increase the `gasCost` for users.

### Impact

- Users with smaller asset holdings may find withdrawal costs exceed the value of their assets, making transactions economically unfeasible.
- If the transaction exceeds the block gas limit, it will fail, leaving user funds inaccessible within the contract.

### Mitigation

Consider avoiding executing multiple actions within a single transaction, particularly when those actions are part of an unbounded or dynamic loop
