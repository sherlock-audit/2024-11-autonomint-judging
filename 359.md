# aBOND token holders never receive yields from liquidation

### Summary

When a borrower deposits ETH as collateral and then withdraws their collateral, they are minted yield earning aBONDs in an amount equal to ~50% of their collateral value (depending on the current price of ETH). 

According to the sponsors, aBOND token holders should receive part of the yield earned via liquidations. This yield is accounted for via the `Treasury::usdaGainedFromLiquidation` state variable which is updated using `Treasury:::updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation`:
```solidity
function updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(
        uint256 amount,
        bool operation
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
        if (operation) {
@>       usdaGainedFromLiquidation += amount;
        } else {
@>            usdaGainedFromLiquidation -= amount;
        }
    }
```
When liquidations occur, `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` should increase by `amount`, and when aBOND token holder redeem their yields, `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` should `decrease` by `amount`.

The problem is that `Treasury::updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation` is never called during liquidations, so `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` will always be 0 because it is never increased anywhere in the protocol.

When aBOND token holder call `Borrowing::redeemYields()`:

`BorrowLib::redeemYields()` should send the aBOND token holder their ETH collateral + yields earned via Ionic.

Then, it should transfer any yields from liquidations in the form of USDa to the aBOND token holder:

```solidity
function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {

       ------snip------

         // treasury.usdaGainedFromLiquidation() will return 0 since it's never called during liquidations
@>   uint128 usdaToAbondRatioLiq = uint128((treasury.usdaGainedFromLiquidation() * RATE_PRECISION) / abond.totalSupply());

         // usdaToTransfer will always return 0 since usdaToAbondRatioLiq is always 0
@>   uint256 usdaToTransfer = (usdaToAbondRatioLiq * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION;

        treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false);

        treasury.approveTokens(
            IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa,
            borrow,
            (usdaToBurn + usdaToTransfer)
        );

        IUSDa usda = IUSDa(usdaAddress);

        bool burned = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), usdaToBurn);
        if (!burned) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        // Since usdaToTransfer is always 0, aBOND token holders never receive any yield from liquidations
        if (usdaToTransfer > 0) {
@>          bool transferred = usda.contractTransferFrom(
                address(treasury),
                user,
                usdaToTransfer
            );
            if (!transferred) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_TransferFailed();
        }

        uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

        bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount);
        if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        return withdrawAmount;
    }
```

But since yields aren't accounted for during liquidations, aBOND token holders never receive their yields from liquidations.


### Root Cause

`Treasury:::updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation` is never called during liquidations to account for yield that should be passed to aBOND token holders.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There must be at least one liquidation that occurs before an aBOND token holder goes to redeem their yields

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. A Alive deposits ETh as collateral and then withdraws that collateral, receiving aBOND tokens from the protocol.
2. Bob gets liquidated
3. Alice calls `Borrowing::redeemYields()` and should receive part of the yield from Bob's liquidation, but doesn't because `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` never gets increased by the amount it should to account for Bob being liquidated.

### Impact

Loss of funds for aBOND token holders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure to call `Treasury:::updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation` and do the math necessary to account for yields that should be distributed to aBOND token holders.
