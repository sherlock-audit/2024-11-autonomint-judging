# Malicious users can block admins from accessing setter functions

### Summary

executeSetterFunction() in multiSign.sol lacks access control so malicious users can prevent admins from accessing setters.

### Root Cause

Some admin setters in borrowing.sol and CDS.sol require a call to multiSign.sol::executeSetterFunction(). If checks in executeSetterFunction() pass admins' approvals for the setters are reset. However, executeSetterFunction() can be called by anyone, so malicious users can call this function first and reset the admins' approvals which will block admins from calling the setters.
```solidity
    function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
        require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user notices that an approval threshold for a certain setter was met
2. Malicious user calls executeSetterFunction() on multiSign.sol which resets the approvals
3. Admins get blocked from calling the setter

### Impact

5 admin setters in both borrowing.sol and CDS.sol require executeSetterFunction() call so all of them can be DOS'ed by malicious users. Some of setters like setAPR(), setLTV(), setBondRatio() in borrowing.sol can negatively impact user experience if DOS'ed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control to executeSetterFunction().
