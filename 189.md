# cds holders will lose their deposit if collateral price goes down in value when they withdraw

### Summary

There is a substraction of collateral amount and value of that collateral and liquidation in eth at time of withdraw

### Root Cause

We can look at this expression: `weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.weETH_ExchangeRate)` which is the same for weETH and rsETH

```solidity
->                        weETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
                            weETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
                        } else if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH) {
              ... 
               }
                uint256 returnAmountWithGains = params.returnAmount + params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
                returnAmountWithGains -= params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount;
                // Calculate the yields which is accured between liquidation and now
                interfaces.treasury.updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts(
->                    weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.weETH_ExchangeRate) + 
                    rsETHAmount - ((rsETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.rsETH_ExchangeRate)
                );
```

Lets look whats this values are from this code:
```solidity
        // Store the liquidation info in cds
        liquidationInfo = CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo(
            liquidationAmountNeeded,
            cdsProfits,
->            depositDetail.depositedAmount,
            omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount,
            depositDetail.assetName,
->            ((depositDetail.depositedAmount * exchangeRate) / 1 ether)
        );
```

Sum up those:

$$
share * amount - share * amount * exchangeRateAtLiquidation / 1ether * 1 ether / exchangeRateAtWithdraw 
$$


$$
amount - amount * exchangeRateAtLiquidation / exchangeRateAtWithdraw 
$$

This means if price at liquidation more than price at withdraw there will underflow error when users tries to withdraw their funds until it will not be true, which might never come.

The same issue happens here with `collateralProfitsOfLiquidators` :
```solidity
                    params.omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators -= totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users funds will be stuck if for any collateral  this is true exchangeRateAtLiquidation > exchangeRateAtWithdraw
which will happen all the time as price goes up and down

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Handle overflow which will to happen here
`weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.weETH_ExchangeRate)`
`params.omniChainData.collateralProfitsOfLiquidators -= totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH;`
