# Stale Price Usage in Strike Price Gains Calculation Leading to Incorrect Option Payouts in `Options.sol::calculateStrikePriceGains()`

## Summary
The calculateStrikePriceGains function uses a price parameter passed at function call time without validating its freshness, potentially using stale prices for critical option payout calculations.

## Vulnerability Details:
The function accepts an ETH price as a parameter and uses it directly in calculations without any freshness validation. When the transaction is eventually executed, this price could be significantly different from the current market price, leading to incorrect calculations. This is particularly problematic because the function name suggests it's using "current" values, but there's no guarantee the price is current at execution time.

```solidity
function calculateStrikePriceGains(
    uint128 depositedAmount,
    uint128 strikePrice,
    uint64 ethPrice
) external view onlyBorrowingContract returns (uint128) {
    uint64 currentEthPrice = ethPrice;  // Stale price used
    uint128 currentEthValue = depositedAmount * currentEthPrice;  // Calculations with stale price
    // ... rest of calculation ...
}
```

## Impact
The use of stale prices in option calculations can lead to significant financial implications for both users and the protocol. When options are executed using outdated prices, users might receive incorrect payouts that don't reflect the actual market conditions. This creates opportunities for MEV (Miner Extractable Value) where validators could delay transactions until price movements are in their favor. Additionally, the protocol's risk calculations and hedging strategies could be compromised, potentially leading to unexpected losses or gains that weren't properly accounted for in the protocol's risk models.

## PoC:
// Time T0:
ETH Price = $2,000
Transaction submitted

// Time T1 (delay):
ETH Price = $2,200
Transaction still pending

// Time T2:
Transaction executes with $2,000 price
// 10% difference in payout calculations

## Recommendation
Consider using TWAP for more stability
Add timestamp validation
