# withdrawFromExternalProtocolDuringLiq will always revert due to incorrect logic

### Summary

The incorrect logic check when trying to [Withdraw from External Protocol During Liquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L314) would always lead to a revert.

### Root Cause

In `treasury.sol:309`, the line captures the current Ether balance of the contract and stores it in the variable `balanceBeforeWithdraw`
```solidity
        uint256 balanceBeforeWithdraw = address(this).balance;    //@>
```
The result is that the contract's Ether balance before the withdrawal operation is saved in the variable balanceBeforeWithdraw. This allows the function to later calculate changes to the contract's balance after certain operations, such as the withdrawal from the external protocol.

- Now in `treasury.sol:314` a [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L314) is done to assume the balance of the contract will increase by exactly redeemAmount after calling `withdrawFromIonicDuringLiq`
```solidity 
        if (address(this).balance < redeemAmount + balanceBeforeWithdraw) revert Treasury_WithdrawExternalProtocolDuringLiqFailed();
```

Now this logic would always revert due to because the balance has been set to the balance of this contract, so, any other amount, added must always lead to a revert .

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `balanceBeforeWithdraw = address(this).balance;` the contract balance has been stored in the `balanceBeforeWithdraw`
2. Assume Balance of contract = 100Eth, since it's stored, `balanceBeforeWithdraw` has 100Eth
3. Assuming redeem amount is 1Eth
4. Applying the logic 
    If (100Eth < 1Eth + 100Eth) Revert 
5. It would always revert 

### Impact

Withdrawal for External Protocol During Liquidation would always fail.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I recommend modifying the logic to isolate the effect of the withdrawal.
