# USDa/USDT Redemption Price Oracle Manipulation Vulnerability

### Summary
The CDS contract's `redeemUSDT` function allows users to redeem USDa tokens for USDT using user-provided price inputs without any oracle validation or price verification. This creates a critical vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate input prices to extract excess USDT from the protocol's treasury.

### Impact

The vulnerability's impact cascades through the protocol's economic mechanisms. By exploiting the price input manipulation, attackers can systematically extract USDT from the treasury at artificially favorable rates. This drain on USDT reserves directly undermines the protocol's ability to maintain its redemption guarantees. As the treasury's USDT reserves diminish, the protocol's capacity to process legitimate redemptions deteriorates, forcing other users into a disadvantaged position where they must either accept unfavorable redemption rates or hold increasingly unstable USDa tokens.

The attack's repetitive nature compounds its severity. Each successful exploitation not only depletes USDT reserves but also creates market pressure on the USDa peg. The divergence between the manipulated redemption rate and actual market prices introduces arbitrage opportunities that rational actors will exploit, further accelerating the depletion of reserves. This feedback loop between reserve drainage and peg instability can ultimately push the protocol toward insolvency, as maintaining the redemption mechanism becomes economically unsustainable in the face of continued exploitation.
### Proof of Concept

The vulnerability exists in the core redemption function where price inputs are accepted directly from users:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506

```solidity
function redeemUSDT(
    uint128 usdaAmount,
    uint64 usdaPrice,      // Manipulatable
    uint64 usdtPrice       // Manipulatable
) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(6)) {
    // No price validation
    uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
}
```

An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the price inputs to extract value. Consider this attack flow:

```solidity
// Assuming real market rates: 1 USDa = 1 USDT

// Attacker manipulates prices
uint64 manipulatedUsdaPrice = 2;  // Inflated USDa price
uint64 manipulatedUsdtPrice = 1;  // Normal USDT price
uint128 usdaAmount = 1000e18;     // 1000 USDa

// Execute redemption
// usdtAmount = (2 * 1000) / 1 = 2000 USDT
cds.redeemUSDT(usdaAmount, manipulatedUsdaPrice, manipulatedUsdtPrice);
// Attacker receives 2000 USDT for 1000 USDa

// Convert back using real market rates
// Profit = 1000 USDT per cycle
```

The attack remains profitable until treasury reserves are depleted or the function is paused.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The core issue stems from trusting user-provided prices without validation. A robust solution requires implementing oracle-based price verification and protective mechanisms.

First, the redemption function should be modified to use oracle prices instead of user inputs:

```solidity
function redeemUSDT(uint128 usdaAmount) external payable nonReentrant {
    uint256 usdaPrice = usdaOracle.getPrice();
    uint256 usdtPrice = usdtOracle.getPrice();
    
    require(
        abs(usdaPrice - usdtPrice) <= MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION,
        "Price deviation too high"
    );
    
    uint128 usdtAmount = (usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice;
}
```

Protection against market manipulation attempts should include temporal constraints and volume monitoring:

```solidity
uint256 public redemptionsInBlock;
uint256 public lastRedemptionBlock;

function redeemUSDT(
    uint128 usdaAmount,
    uint128 minUsdtOut,
    uint256 deadline
) external {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Redemption expired");
    
    if (block.number > lastRedemptionBlock) {
        redemptionsInBlock = 0;
        lastRedemptionBlock = block.number;
    }
    
    uint256 fee = calculateDynamicFee(usdaAmount);
    uint256 usdtAfterFee = usdtAmount - fee;
    require(usdtAfterFee >= minUsdtOut, "Insufficient output amount");
}
```

This comprehensive approach ensures price accuracy while protecting against exploitation through rate limiting and economic incentives.
