# Deadline Validation Flaw in BorrowLib.sol Allows Early and Late Option Renewals

### Summary

A logical error in the ``BorrowLib.sol::getOptionFeesTOPay`` function causes the deadline check for renewing options to fail, allowing users to bypass the intended 15–30 day renewal window. This flaw not only breaks core functionality but also enables users to evade renewal fees when renewing options earlier than 15 days, causing financial losses to the protocol.



### Root Cause

The deadline check for user eligibility to renew options is implemented incorrectly using the ``&&`` operator instead of the ``||``operator.
This creates a condition that can never be satisfied because a timestamp cannot simultaneously be less than 15 days and greater than 30 days.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Bypassing Renewal Deadline**:
Users can renew options outside the 15–30 day eligibility window, undermining the protocol's core logic.
- **Loss of Fees for Early Renewals**:
Renewals made before 15 days result in negligible fees being collected due to the incorrect fee calculation.

### PoC

1. **Scenario**:
User A creates an option at ``T=0``.
At ``T<15`` days, User A renews the option using the flawed ``getOptionFeesToPay`` logic.
2. **Outcome**:
The function does not revert because the && condition is never satisfied.
Negligible fees are calculated and paid due to the minimal time difference.
3. **Exploitation**:
User A repeats the process to exploit the protocol for minimal fees while renewing options outside the intended window.

```solidity
if (
    block.timestamp <
    depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
    block.timestamp >
    depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```


### Mitigation

Replace the ``&&`` operator with the ``||`` operator in the conditional check to correctly enforce the eligibility window.
```solidity
if (
    block.timestamp <
    depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
    block.timestamp >
    depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```
