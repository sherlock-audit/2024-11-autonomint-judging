# The same hardcoded gas limits are used for all chains

### Summary

When LayerZero messages are sent to LayerZero bridges the contracts use hardcoded gas limits when sending cross-chain messages. The issue is that different destination chains may require different amounts of gas.

### Root Cause

In GlobalVariable.sol, CDS.sol and borrowing.sol hardcoded gas amounts are used when sending messages to LayerZero bridges:

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A message is sent to a LayerZero bridge with hardcoded gas amounts.
2. As the gas amounts are hardcoded and the same for each destination chain, the `lzReceive` function on the receiving contract may revert, due to insufficient gas limits.

### Impact

LayerZero messages may fail to be received on the destination chain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Gas limits should not be hardcoded but instead calculated independently based on the destination chain.
