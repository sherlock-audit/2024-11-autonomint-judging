# Exchange Rate Fluctuation Causing Reverts in CDS `Withdraw` for `weETH`and `rsETH`

### Summary

The current implementation for calculating `weETHAmount` and `rsETHAmount` during the CDS `withdrawal` function relies on the exchange rate (`params.weETH_ExchangeRate` and `params.rsETH_ExchangeRate`) at the time of withdrawal. If the exchange rate drops after liquidation, the calculations result in an underflow, causing the CDS `withdrawal` function to revert. This issue temporarily pauses the `withdrawal` function until the exchange rate rises again, disrupting the system's functionality.

### Root Cause

1. Underflow Due to Exchange Rate Drop:

The calculation for `weETHAmount` uses:
`((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) / params.weETH_ExchangeRate)`
If the exchange rate (`params.weETH_ExchangeRate`) drops between liquidation and withdrawal, the computed value becomes greater than the original `weETHAmount`, leading to an underflow in the subtraction operation.

2. A similar issue arises with rsETHAmount.

3. Also during yield calculation

4. One-Sided Dependency: The logic assumes that the exchange rate will not drop. This assumption fails in volatile market conditions, making the system unable to handle downward fluctuations effectively.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A user deposits `weETH` or `rsETH` collateral and gets liquidated. The collateral value in ETH is calculated based on the exchange rate at liquidation.
If the exchange rate drops before withdrawal, the subtraction operation in the withdrawal logic causes an underflow and reverts the transaction.


### Impact

Denial of Service (DoS): CDS deposited who opted for liquidation are temporarily unable to withdraw when exchange rates drop, impacting the reliability of the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Their should be an if condition to determine the current exchange rate before these calculations
