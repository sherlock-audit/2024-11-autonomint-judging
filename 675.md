# Malicious Users Can DOS Withdrawals for All Borrowers by Manipulating `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers`

### Summary

The `BorrowLib` contract contains a logical issue in the borrower count management mechanism. Specifically, the `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` global variable is incremented when a user deposits for the first time that increase the numbers of borrowers in the protocol but fails to increment properly if the user deposits again after withdrawing all collateral. This discrepancy allows a malicious user to repeatedly manipulate the `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` variable, potentially reducing it to zero, which can freeze all withdrawals in the protocol.


### Root Cause


If a user deposits collateral in the borrowing contract, If its the first index of the borrower the `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` is incremented by 1 in the protocol that calcualted the borrowers. this `depositResult.borrowerIndex` is return from the treasury external call so after that if this user is deposit tokens it only increment the borrowerIndex for each deposit `++omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` will never execute for that user because there is no implementation that borrowerIndex is changed or decremented.

```solidity
        // If its the first index of the borrower, then increment the numbers of borrowers in the protocol
        if (depositResult.borrowerIndex == 1) {
            ++omniChainData.noOfBorrowers;
        }
```

If a user withdraws their collateral from the borrowing contract the logic in here is that if a borrower withdraws all their collateral `getTotalDeposited` for that specifci user is equal to `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`, the `--omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` is executed and decreased by 1.


```solidity
        // update the global omnichain data
        if (interfaces.treasury.getTotalDeposited(msg.sender) == depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) {
            --omniChainData.noOfBorrowers;
        }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L915-L917


The problem lies in the logic of the code. It is implemented such that if `interfaces.treasury.getTotalDeposited(msg.sender) == depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`, the value of `--omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` in the protocol is decreased. However, the issue arises when a user deposits again; the `if (depositResult.borrowerIndex == 1) {..}` statement will not be executed because the borrower index is never decreased in the protocol. Consequently, if this borrower withdraws their collateral again, `--omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` will be executed once more, and the `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` value will be decremented again for a user who was only incremented once.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path


1. A malicious user deposits collateral for the first time, incrementing `++omniChainData.noOfBorrowers`.
2. The user withdraws the entire collateral, decrementing `--omniChainData.noOfBorrowers`.
3. The user deposits collateral again, bypassing the increment logic in the deposit function because `if (depositResult.borrowerIndex == 1)` is only executed for the first time a user deposits, as the borrower index is always increased and never reset.
4. The user repeats steps 2 and 3 to progressively reduce `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers`.
5. Once `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` reaches zero, withdrawals by other users that are blocked as the protocol assumes no active borrowers remain.


### Impact


The manipulation of `omniChainData.noOfBorrowers` can result in the protocol being unable to process withdrawals for legitimate users. This can create a DOS scenario for all users of the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Update the withdrawal logic to reset the borrower index when a user withdraws all their collateral:

```solidity
if (interfaces.treasury.getTotalDeposited(msg.sender) == depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) {
    --omniChainData.noOfBorrowers;
+   depositResult.borrowerIndex = 0;
}
```
