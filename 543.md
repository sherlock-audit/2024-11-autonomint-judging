# Insufficient Funds for LZ Fee Transaction in `liquidate` Function During `liquidationType1`

### Summary

The `borrowing::liquidate` function does not reserve sufficient native tokens for the LayerZero transaction fee (`fee.nativeFee`) when handling cases where the `liquidationType1` function in the `BorrowLiquidation` is call from the `liquidate` function to liquidate a position, in this function if `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` is greater than zero (`liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain > 0`) or zero `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0` in both cases the entire `msg.value` is send. This results in the failure of the `globalVariables.sendForLiquidation` call due to insufficient native token funds.  


### Root Cause


In `liquidationType1`, when `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain > 0`, the entire `msg.value` is sent to the `globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` function, leaving no remaining balance to cover the LZ transaction fee required by `globalVariables.sendForLiquidation`.  

```solidity
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain > 0) {
            // Call the oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains function in global variables
@>            globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: msg.value}(
                IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(3),
                IGlobalVariables.USDaOftTransferData(address(treasury),liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain),
                // Since we don't need ETH, we have passed zero params
                IGlobalVariables.CollateralTokenTransferData(address(0),0,0,0),
                IGlobalVariables.CallingFunction.BORROW_LIQ,
                admin
            );
```

And when it's zero the entire `msg.value` is also sent leaving no remaining balance to cover the LZ transaction fee required by `globalVariables.sendForLiquidation{value: fee.nativeFee}`.  

```solidity
        if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


There is no direct attack path; if the liquidation is of type liquidationType1, it will always revert the liquidation process due to insufficient funds to send the LZ transaction: globalVariables.sendForLiquidation{value: fee.nativeFee}.


### Impact

If the liquidation is of type `liquidationType1`, it will always revert the liquidation process due to insufficient funds to send the LZ transaction: `globalVariables.sendForLiquidation{value: fee.nativeFee}`.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


1. Reserve `fee.nativeFee` from `msg.value` before any other operation to ensure sufficient funds remain for the LZ transaction.  
2. Update the logic in `liquidationType1` to deduct `fee.nativeFee` before transferring the remaining funds to `globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` or the user.  
3. Add validation checks to ensure `msg.value >= fee.nativeFee` before proceeding with the liquidation process.  


```solidity
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain > 0) {
    require(msg.value >= fee.nativeFee, "Insufficient funds for LZ fee");
    uint256 remainingValue = msg.value - fee.nativeFee;
    globalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains{value: remainingValue}(...);
} else {
    require(msg.value >= fee.nativeFee, "Insufficient funds for LZ fee");
    uint256 remainingValue = msg.value - fee.nativeFee;
    (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: remainingValue}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
globalVariables.sendForLiquidation{value: fee.nativeFee}(...);
```
