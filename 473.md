# Malicious user can replay withdrawal signatures to drain CDS protocol

### Summary

Missing signature nonce enforcement in `CDS.sol` will allow unlimited withdrawal signature replays by malicious users as signatures are verified against user-supplied nonces rather than protocol-tracked nonces.

### Root Cause

In `CDS.sol:L285` the signature verification process uses a user-supplied nonce parameter instead of tracking nonces at the protocol level, allowing signature replays.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to have received a valid withdrawal signature

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains a valid withdrawal signature from admin
2. Attacker executes first withdrawal with the signature successfully
3. Attacker replays same signature multiple times to perform unauthorized withdrawals
4. Process can be repeated indefinitely as signature remains valid

### Impact

The protocol suffers unlimited unauthorized withdrawals. Attacker gains access to repeated withdrawals using a single signature.

### Mitigation

Add protocol-level nonce tracking:

1. Add storage variable:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) nonces;
```

2. Modify withdraw() function to enforce nonce checking:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L285

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint64 index,
    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes memory signature
) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
++  require(nonce == nonces[msg.sender]);
++  nonces[msg.sender]++;
    if (!_verify(FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW, excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, "0x", signature)) revert CDS_NotAnAdminTwo();
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```
