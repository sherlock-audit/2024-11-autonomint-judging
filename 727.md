# Broken `option renewal` validation with current timestamp

### Summary


The system forces users to renew only in-between `optionsRenewedTimeStamp` + 15 to 30 days, but due to wrong validation, it can be renewed at any time (before 15 days, between 15 to 30 days, after 30 days)


### Root Cause



Using && instead of || when validation current time with `optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 or 30 days`



### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path




When [Borrowing.renewOptions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L621) is called, [getOptionFeesToPay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L445-L451) will be called to determine the option fee. And there, the current time is validated with `optionsRenewedTimeStamp` + 15 or 30 days. The issue is, that the validation will never revert no matter the timestamp due to the `&&` use instead of `||` use.

if (`block.timestamp` is < optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days) ~~ wont revert
(`block.timestamp` is == optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days) ~~ wont revert
(`block.timestamp` is > optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days) && (`block.timestamp` < optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days) ~~ wont revert
(`block.timestamp` == optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days) ~~ wont revert
(`block.timestamp` > optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days) ~~ wont revert


The correct validation should be using `||` operator, so that if the current time is not in between `optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days` and `optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days`, it should revert. But here revert currently doesn't happen in any case.


[getOptionFeesToPay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L445-L451)

```solidity

    function getOptionFeesToPay( ITreasury treasury, uint64 index) public view returns (uint256) {
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;

        if (getBorrowingResult.totalIndex >= index) {
            if (depositDetail.withdrawed && depositDetail.liquidated)
                revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyWithdrewOrLiquidated();
            if (
                block.timestamp <
    @>>         depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days && 
                block.timestamp >
    @>>         depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();

        } else {
            revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InvalidIndex();
        }
    }
```

### Impact


Options can be renewed at any time, while it should only be renewed between `optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 to 30 days`. Broken core contract functionality.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


use || instead of && on that line
