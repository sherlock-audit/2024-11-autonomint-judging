# Current implementation of Oracle doesn't validate for the minAnswer/maxAnswer values

### Summary

In the `depositTokens` function of borrowing contract `getUSDValue` function is being called to fetch price from the oracle.
```solidity
(uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(
            assetAddress[depositParam.assetName]
        );
```
`getUSDValue` function fetch the price from the oracle. In price function there is no checks whic validate for the the minAnswer/maxAnswer values.

### Root Cause

Current implementation of Oracle doesn't validate for the minAnswer/maxAnswer values.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Chainlink still has feeds that uses the min/maxAnswer to limit the range of values and hence in case of a price crash, incorrect price will be used to value the assets allowing users to exploit this incorrectness.

 I am attaching the link to ETH/USD oracle which still uses min/maxAnswer on optimism chain:

### Impact

In the event of flash crash, there will be incorrect values which will leads to malicious outcomes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the price is outside the minPrice/maxPrice of the oracle, activate a breaker to reduce further losses.
