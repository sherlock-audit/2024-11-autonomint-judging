# Re-usable signatures can lead to loss of funds.

### Summary

The [CDS::_verify](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L878) function is used to verify the signature provided by the protocol for a permissioned activity.
This function is called in [`CDS::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L279) and by borrowing contract's `withDraw` function via [`CDS::verify`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L864)
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint64 index,
        uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
        if (!_verify(FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW, excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, "0x", signature)) revert CDS_NotAnAdminTwo();
```
```solidity
    function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
        // check is _toAddress in not a zero address and isContract address
        if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);

        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer(); 
```
However, neither the nonce used is accounted nor the signature used is stored to disallow re-use of these signatures.
Attackers can copy signatures as they are independent of any user dependent values.

### Root Cause

In [CDS.sol:865](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L864), verify function does not store signatures or nonces to disallow any kind of re-use.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker simply monitors blockchain for any user using the `CDS::withdraw` function.
2. The attacker can easily copy the signature passed in the params from a public blockchain explorer.
3.  Now, the attacker will see if the `excessProfitCumulativeValue` passed in the above param is profitable to him or not according to his own position if it's withdrawn via `CDS::withdraw` using this gained signature (can use a static call to check)
4. If it's advantageous, attacker will withdraw using the `CDS::withdraw` or simply watch-out for other such opportunity.


### Impact

1. Loss of funds due to manipulated `excessProfitCumulativeValue` being used by the attacker to withdraw using `CDS::withdraw`
2. Functions that are supposed to be gate kept can be bypassed without protocol's explicit permissions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to implement a `nonce` storing or signature storing mechanism to avoid re-use.
