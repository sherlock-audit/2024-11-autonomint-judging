# Underflow revert in `liquidationType1` due to `borrowerDebt` amount being more than the amount of collateral asset deposited.

### Summary

There are 2 instances of underflow revert in `liquidationType1` due to same root cause. 

This issue will occur when the borrower's total amount of debt to repay (with intrest), will be bigger than the collateral asset amount they deposited at the time of taking the loan.   

### Root Cause

The root cause is the unchecked growth of `borrowerDebt` over time, which can exceed the initial collateral amount deposited by borrower.

This is due to the cumulative rate calculation  to calculate debt not being capped at the deposited collateral amount. 

In `borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1` borrower's total debt with intrest is calculated, which is then set to `uint128 returnToTreasury`

```solidity
        uint256 borrowerDebt = ((depositDetail.normalizedAmount * lastCumulativeRate) / BorrowLib.RATE_PRECISION);
        uint128 returnToTreasury = uint128(borrowerDebt);
```

So now if this amount `returnToTreasury` comes bigger than amount of collateral deposited by borrower at the time of deposit, ie. `depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit` then this will cause underflow revert in two instances:

1. first instance of underflow revert is in calculating [BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L209): 

```solidity
@->        uint128 returnToAbond = BorrowLib.calculateReturnToAbond(
            depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH, depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, returnToTreasury
        );
```  

Revert here in [calculations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L143) because value of `returnToTreasury` is bigger than value of `(((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100)` so when this subtraction will happen it will revert!  

```solidity
    function calculateReturnToAbond(uint128 depositedAmount, uint128 depositEthPrice, uint128 returnToTreasury)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint128)
    {
@->>       return (((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;
    }
```

2. Second instance of underflow revert is in calculating [cdsProfits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L212) we can clearly see here value of this `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100)` is going to lesser than `returnToTreasury` & ` returnToAbond` as they both are combined going to be subtracted from that. 

So here also underflow revert will happen.

```solidity
        uint128 cdsProfits = (
            ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury - returnToAbond;
```


### Internal pre-conditions

This issue will occur when the borrower's total amount of debt to repay (with interest) that is `returnToTreasury` will be bigger than the collateral asset amount the borrower deposited at the the time of taking debt.   


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Admin won't be able to execute function `LiquidationType1` permanently and won't be able to liquidate borrower even when borrower's "borrowing Health" was bad, leading to bad debt inside protocol.
- It can result in financial losses for the protocol and CDS participants as they also get profit from liquidation.
- This can lead to unfair advantages for malicious borrowers who won't give their debt back, as they know that now their total debt amount is more than their collateral deposited, and still they can't be liquidated.


### PoC

Revert here in calculation -> 

- example - (((((1e18 * 1000e2) / 1e12) / 100) - 1200e6) * 10) / 100
 
Where `(((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100)` is deposited amount at the time of deposit = 1000e6
and where accured total debt `returnToTreasury` = 1200e6  

(((((1e18 * 1000e2) / 1e12) / 100) - 1200e6) * 10) / 100 => Underfolow REVERT!

```solidity
    function calculateReturnToAbond(uint128 depositedAmount, uint128 depositEthPrice, uint128 returnToTreasury)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint128)
    {
@->        return (((((depositedAmount * depositEthPrice) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100) - returnToTreasury) * 10) / 100;
    }
```

### Mitigation

Have a mechanism for liquidation where borrower will get liquidated before his totalDebt amount to pay 'exceeds' more than the collateral amount deposited by him.
