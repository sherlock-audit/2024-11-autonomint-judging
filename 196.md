# Liquidations and withdrawals of borrow position wrongly calculate borrowing health

### Summary
Borrowing Health in liquidation and withdrawing a position is calculated wrongly as it assumes all collaterals `rsETH`, `wrsETH`, `wETH` have the exact same exchange rate.

### Root Cause

In withdrawal of borrower position or liquidation of that same position we use `calculateEthPriceRatio()`  to calculate the borrowing health. [BorrowLib.sol#L819-L822](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L819-L822)
```solidity
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000, "You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");
```
or in borrowingLib.sol:
```solidity
        if (!depositDetail.withdrawed) {
            // Calculate the borrowingHealth
            uint128 borrowingHealth = calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, params.ethPrice);
            // Check the health is grater thsn 0.8
            if (borrowingHealth < 8000) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();
```
In both cases, the `ethPrice` is used as the reference to calculate the borrowing health. However, users are not limited to using only `ETH` as collateral. They can also use `rsETH`, `wrsETH`, or `wETH`, which do not have **1:1 exchange rates** with `ETH` and, in some cases, can differ by 10% or more in price.

```solidity
    function calculateEthPriceRatio(uint128 depositEthPrice, uint128 currentEthPrice) public pure returns (uint128) {
@>>     return (currentEthPrice * 10000) / depositEthPrice;
    }
```

Not only are the prices different, but the daily percentage changes in the price can also differ from raw ETH by a few percent. This variance is critical for TVL calculations, as the protocol compares the amount of debt issued at the time of deposit with the collateral's current value.

### Impact

This discrepancy results in inaccurate checks, potentially causing false-positive denial of service (DoS) for withdrawals or triggering incorrect liquidations. Conversely, it could also prevent liquidations of positions that should be liquidated.

### Mitigation

Use the exchange rate of the specific asset that the borrower used as collateral, rather than relying solely on raw ETH prices.
