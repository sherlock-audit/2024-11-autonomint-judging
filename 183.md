# cdsPoolValue will not be tracked properly after liquidations

### Summary

liquidation doesn't substract `liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits` from cdsPoolValue

### Root Cause

On liquidation system does substract needed amount of tokens from `totalCdsDepositedAmount` `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` to reduce their amount of tokens in the system because they have beed used for liquidation to get borrowers collateral and they are not longer available in system but its not happening for `cdsPoolValue`
```solidity
        omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits; //! need to revisit this
        omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits;
        omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits;
```

Its been used in computing ratio between cds and borrowing
```solidity
            // BAsed on the eth prices, add or sub, profit and loss respectively
            if (currentEthPrice >= lastEthprice) {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue += netPLCdsPool;
            } else {
                previousData.cdsPoolValue -= netPLCdsPool;
            }
            previousData.totalCDSPool = latestTotalCDSPool;
            currentCDSPoolValue = previousData.cdsPoolValue * USDA_PRECISION;
        }

        // Calculate ratio by dividing currentEthVaultValue by currentCDSPoolValue,
        // since it may return in decimals we multiply it by 1e6
        uint64 ratio = uint64((currentCDSPoolValue * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / currentVaultValue);
        return (ratio, previousData);
    }
```
which means ratio will be more than should -> borrowers will be able to borrow more than they should and cds holders will be able to withdraw more than they should and not to protect borrowers when they should. It seems like important for protocol to keep ratio between cds and borrowers which will not be enforced correctly

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

always happening after liquidation

### Impact

1. borrowers will be able to borrow more than they should 
2. cds holders will be able to withdraw more than they should and not to protect borrowers when they should

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It should be like this and also change how its handled on cds withdraw, so it will be the same like totalCdsDepositedAmount
```diff
        omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits; //! need to revisit this
        omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits;
        omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits;
+        omniChainData.cdsPoolValue -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits;

```
