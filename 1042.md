# The `CDS.withdraw` will be DOS when current `exchangeRate` is fewer than liquidation exchangeRate

## Summary

There is calculation for the weeth and rseth amount without yields. But this calculation could revert in some case.

## Root Cause

In the [CDSLib.sol:672](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L672) `withdrawUser()` calculates the weeth and rseth amount without yields. 

The `weETHAmountInETHValue` is the eth amount for weETH based on liquidation exchangeRate. The exchangeRate varies and when current `exchangeRate` is fewer than liquidation exchangeRate, `(weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) / params.weETH_ExchangeRate)` will be greater than `weETHAmount`.

As result, `CDSLib.withdrawUswer()` will revert and this breaks the invariants of protocol - "New Borrows cannot mint new stablecoin if cds/borrow ratio is below 0.2 and cds users cannot withdraw."

```solidity
    function withdrawUser(
        CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees,
        mapping(uint128 liquidationIndex => CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo)
            storage omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {

        ...

        // Calculate the weeth and rseth amount without yields
        weETHAmount = weETHAmount - (weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) / params.weETH_ExchangeRate));
        rsETHAmount = rsETHAmount - (rsETHAmount - ((rsETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) / params.rsETH_ExchangeRate));

        ...
    }
```

## Attack Path

## Impact

CDS users can't withdraw and this could break the invariants of the protocol

## Mitigation

Implement correct handling for cases where current `exchangeRate` is fewer than liquidation exchangeRate.
