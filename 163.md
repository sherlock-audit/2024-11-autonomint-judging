# The vault's profit and loss are wiped out upon borrower withdrawal.

### Summary

lastEthprice updated on borrower's withdraw which leads to incorrectly tracked `cdsPoolValue` which means cds holders might be stuck.

### Root Cause
When call happens: `borrowing.withDraw`, `lastEthprice` is updated when it should not. Up until when borrowers decided to withdraw there is some profit and loss happens to the vault which is being disregarded as lastEthprice updated but vault's value didn't change. 

net P/L of CDS Pool will be always updating as eth price is not tracked properly.
```solidity
    function calculateRatio(
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 currentEthPrice,
        uint128 lastEthprice,
        uint256 noOfDeposits,
        uint256 totalCollateralInETH,
        uint256 latestTotalCDSPool,
        IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory previousData
    ) public pure returns (uint64, IGlobalVariables.OmniChainData memory) {
        uint256 netPLCdsPool;

        // Calculate net P/L of CDS Pool
        // if the current eth price is high
        if (currentEthPrice > lastEthprice) {
            // profit, multiply the price difference with total collateral
->            netPLCdsPool = (((currentEthPrice - lastEthprice) * totalCollateralInETH) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100;
        } else {
            // loss, multiply the price difference with total collateral
->            netPLCdsPool = (((lastEthprice - currentEthPrice) * totalCollateralInETH) / USDA_PRECISION) / 100;
        }
...
    }
```

Which means ratio will not be tracked properly and some cds holders will not be able to withdraw due to the fact they will be forced to protect against positions that do not exist.

```solidity
        // Check whether after withdraw cds have enough funds to protect borrower's collateral
        if (withdrawResult.omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei != 0) {
            if (borrowing.calculateRatio(0, ethPrice) < (2 * CDSLib.RATIO_PRECISION)) revert CDS_NotEnoughFundInCDS();
        }
```
### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

always happening

### Impact
Worst case scenario
1. Cds holder will be forced to protect against positions that do not exist. Their deposits will be stuck
2. borrowers will not be able to deposits when they should

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Updating of price should be remove as its not used in that function and wipes out profit/loss up until current time 
```diff
        // update the state variables
        totalNormalizedAmount = result.totalNormalizedAmount;
        collateralRemainingInWithdraw = result.collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw = result.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw;

-        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}
```
