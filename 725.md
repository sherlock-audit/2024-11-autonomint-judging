# `strikePrice` is not checked to match `strikePercent` allowing cheaper options

### Summary

In `borrowing.sol` `strikePrice` is not checked to match the given `strikePercent` allowing users to pay lower fees.

### Root Cause

Lack of check for `strikePrice` and `strikePercent` in `borrowings::depositTokens`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `depositTokens` with `strikePercent = TWENTY_FIVE` and a `strikePrice` less than 25% away from the value.
2. During the calculation of the option fees only the `strikePercent` is taken in account meaning that they will receive the lower fee
