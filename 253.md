The `ABONDToken` contract, inherits the `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract from openzeppelin. The contract correctly exposes the internal pause and unpause functions from openzeppellin for the the ease of pausing and unpausing by the contract owner. However there has been a major oversight in correctly implementing these pause mechanism, as the functions that are expected to be paused in a paused state lack the `whenNotPaused` modifiers, which is responsible for ensuring that the functions are not being called while the contract is paused. 
This breaks the core functionality of the pasue mechanism.
