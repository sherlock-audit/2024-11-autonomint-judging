# Reentrancy in the borrowing.renewOptions function

***Summary:***
Functions in Ethereum that make external calls (which could ultimately re-enter that same function), and subsequently modify some state in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), may lead to executions where state is inconsistent, because the original function never completed its state modifications before being re-entered. Note that it is possible that these state modifications may be "remote" from the original function rather than inline statements, as long as they are reachable after the external call.

***POC:***
In the code, the renew options function makes an external call to send a requested amount of Ether. But, the function has no access control modifier, no check that the sender is this address, and no check on the send low-level call.

***Mitigation:***
```diff
+    function renewOptions(uint64 index) external payable nonReentrant {
-    function renewOptions(uint64 index) external payable {

+    require(msg.sender == address(this), "Wrong sender");

        if (
            !BorrowLib.renewOptions(
                Interfaces(
                    treasury,
                    globalVariables,
                    usda,
                    abond,
                    cds,
                    options
                ),
                index
            )
        ) revert Borrow_RenewFailed();


        // Get the deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
        treasury.updateDepositDetails(msg.sender, index, depositDetail);


        // define options for lz send transaction with 400000 gas(found by testing)
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);


        // calculting fee for lz send transaction
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositDetail.assetName,
            _options,
            false
        );


        // Calling Omnichain send function
+        bool success = globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1), depositDetail.assetName, fee, _options, msg.sender);
+        require(success, "Failed transaction");
-        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1), depositDetail.assetName, fee, _options, msg.sender);

        emit Renewed(msg.sender, index, block.timestamp);
    }
```
In the corrected code, the renew options function has the nonReentrant access modifier; the require statement is added to validate that the sender of from this address; and the send low-level call is checked with a require statement. Even if the caller reenters this function, they will not be able to withdraw more than their allotted balance of Ether, as it will have already been decreased before the first external call was made.
