# No Slippage Control in `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` in `GlobalVariables.sol`

### Summary

Lack of slippage control in `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` in GlobalVariables.sol could result in fewer tokens being received during transfers. An attacker could frontrun the transaction, causing a loss of funds.

### Root Cause

The `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` function in `GlobalVariables.sol` does not implement slippage control mechanisms when transferring OFT (Omnibridge Fungible Token) and native tokens. **The lack of slippage protection could result in the recipient receiving fewer tokens than intended, especially during periods of market volatility**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` function in `GlobalVariables.sol` is called.

### External Pre-conditions

- There is a price change in the assets being transferred.

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains()` to transfer tokens.
2. An attacker frontruns the transaction, causing a price change in the assets being transferred.
3. The user receives fewer tokens than intended due to slippage.

**Affected Code:**

```solidity
function oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains(...) external payable ... returns (MessagingReceipt memory receipt) {
    // ... (existing code) ...
    // Transfer OFT tokens
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokensToSend.length; i++) {
        // ...
        IOFT(assetAddress).send{value: _fee.nativeFee}(
            _sendParam,
            _fee,
            address(this) // No slippage control here
        );
        // ...
    }
    // ... (remaining code) ...
}
```

### Impact

**Users could receive fewer tokens than expected due to slippage**.

### PoC

The sources do not provide a PoC.

### Mitigation

**Implement slippage control mechanisms, such as minimum received amount checks or using decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with built-in slippage protection, to ensure that the recipient receives the intended amount of tokens**.
