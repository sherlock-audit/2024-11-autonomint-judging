# Incorrect calculation for borrowing fees

## Summary

Borrowers should return the entire debt (principal + borrowing fees), while withdrawing. The amount of borrowing fees is calculated based on state variable `lastCumulativeRate` of borrowing.sol. However, borrower should pay more or fewer amount of usda for borrowing fees due to incorrect updating state variable `lastCumulativeRate`.

## Root Cause

In the [borrowing.sol:226](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L226) `depositTokens()` function and the [borrowing.sol:653](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L635-L714) `_withdraw()` function, state variable `lastCumulativeRate` is updated after deposit or withdraw.

In the [BorrowLib.sol:77](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L77) `calculateDebtAmount()` function, it calculates the entire debt based on `lastCumulativeRate`.

However, `borrowing.depositTokens()` and `borrowing._withdraw()` function calculates with old value of `lastCumulativeRate`, which is not current value. And then update `lastCumulativeRate` using `calculateCumulativeRate()`. As result, `borrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate()` calculates incorrect debt for user.

The correct way is to update `lastCumulativeRate` first, then performs deposit and withdraw.

Let's consider following case(For convenience, decimal points have been omitted):

- Current `lastEventTime` = 1730000000, `totalNormalizedAmount` = t.
- User1 deposit at block.timestamp = 1730010000 and receives A amount of usda. It saves `depositDetail.normalizedAmount` = A / t. Then updates `lastCumulativeRate` = t' = t * `ratePerSec` ^ (1730010000 - 1730000000) = t * `ratePerSec` ^ 10000, `lastEventTime` = 1730010000.
- User2 deposit at block.timestamp = 1730050000 and receives B amount of usda. It saves `depositDetail.normalizedAmount` = B / t'. Then updates `lastCumulativeRate` = t'' = t' * `ratePerSec` ^ (1730050000 - 1730010000) = t' * `ratePerSec` ^ 40000 = t * `ratePerSec` ^ 50000, `lastEventTime` = 1730050000.
- User3 withdraw at block.timestamp = 1730070000, then entire debt = `depositDetail.normalizedAmount` * `lastCumulativeRate` = (A / t) * t'' = A * (t'' / t) = A * (t * `ratePerSec` ^ 50000) / t = A * `ratePerSec` ^ 50000.

However, the passed time between deposit and withdraw for user1 is 1730070000 - 1730010000 = 60000. Therefore, user don't need to return borrowing fees for 60000 seconds and return only for 50000 seconds.

As result, protocol will receive less borrowing fees from user. There could also be example where protocol will receive more borrowing fees from user.

## Internal pre-conditions

## External pre-conditions

## Attack Path

## Impact

Borrowers will return less or more borrowing fees while withdrawing, due to incorrect calculation of borrowing fees.

## Mitigation

Update `lastCumulativeRate` before perform deposit and withdraw.
