# A deposit can only be liquidated once it becomes insolvent

### Summary

In order for a deposit to be liquidated its `calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice)` must be lower than 80%. This is problematic as in that case the deposit has definitely become insolvent, considering the accrued interest to the debt. In that case the borrowed debt has a value higher than the value of the collateral and even if the borrower gets liquidated they are not at risk of losing any funds.

Furthermore, accrued interest is not considered when validating whether a deposit can be liquidated, which is highly dangerous as the deposit may become insolvent even before the ETH price ratio has decreased below 80%.

### Root Cause

A deposit ocan only be liquidated once it has become insolvent, thus liquidations do not prevent bad debt from accruing to the protocol.

### Attack Path

1. A user deposits 1 ETH and receives 800 USDa.
2. After one year 50 USDa of interest has accrued and the price of ETH has dropped by 20%.
3. Only now can the deposit be liquidated, however, the position is insolvent and the debt is worth more than the collateral, thus the borrower will not lose any funds once liquidated.

### Impact

Bad debt will constantly accrue into the protocol as borrowers can only be liquidated once their deposit has become insolvent. Thus, as there is no risk of liquidations, borrowers are likely not withdraw collateral that is going down in value.

### Mitigation

Accrued interest should be considered when validating whether a deposit can be liquidated. Furthermore, considering deposits eligible for liquidation when their `calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice)` has gone below 80% is insufficient. A higher percentage will decrease the chances of bad debt accruing.
