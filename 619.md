# Withdrawals may revert due to incorrect accounting

### Summary

When users withdraw from CDS an underflow may occur due to an incorrect accounting of the `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue` variable.

### Root Cause

In CDS.withdraw:395 `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue` is decremented by `cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount`. The issue is that `cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` includes the profit that the deposit has accumulated. As `cdsPoolValue` is only incremented by the initial deposit amount `cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` will either be higher, causing an underflow, or the additional profit will be subtracted from the deposits of other users. Either way, an underflow will eventually occur and users will be unable to withdraw their deposits.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user deposits 1000 USDT, and `cdsPoolValue` is increased to 1000.
2. After some time they decide to withdraw, however, there has been a profit and they withdraw 1100.
3. The withdrawal cannot be executed as `withdraw` reverts due to an underflow of `cdsPoolValue`.

### Impact

Users will be unable to withdraw from CDS.

### Mitigation

Decrement `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue` before `cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` has been set to the return value of `cdsAmountToReturn`:
