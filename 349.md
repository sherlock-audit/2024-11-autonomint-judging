# new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2.

### Summary

 whenover,  the function deposit(cdslib.sol)/ function withdrawUser(cdslib.sol) is called, omniChainData.downsideProtected  is deducted from omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount but omniChainData.downsideProtected  is not deducted from omniChainData.cdsPoolValue. As a result,  omniChainData.cdsPoolValue    will always be bigger than actual/real omniChainData.cdsPoolValue. So the cds/borrow ratio will always be bigger than the actual/real cds/borrow ratio. In some cases , the cds/borrow’s real  ratio may become below 0.2 but the protocol will calculate above 0.2(so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2.
).


### Root Cause

 whenover,  the function deposit(cdslib.sol)/ function withdrawUser(cdslib.sol) is called, omniChainData.downsideProtected  is not deducted from omniChainData.cdsPoolValue.

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, currently omniChainData.downsideProtected = 150,  omniChainData.cdsPoolValue = 500,  omniChainData.vaultValue = 2000, so cds/borrow ratio = 500/2000 = 0.25

2. now the function deposit(cdslib.sol) is called where omniChainData.downsideProtected = 150 is deducted from omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount but omniChainData.downsideProtected = 150 is not deducted from omniChainData.cdsPoolValue. Only 40 depositing amounts(let’s assume) is added to omniChainData.cdsPoolValue. So currently cds/borrow ratio = 540/2000 = 0.27.

3. so cds/borrow actual(real) ratio will be = 540-150/2000 = 390/2000 = 0.195(because now omniChainData.cdsPoolValue is 540-150 = 390, as omniChainData.downsideProtected = 150 is deducted from omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount).

4. but as omniChainData.downsideProtected = 150 is not deducted from omniChainData.cdsPoolValue, so the current cds/borrow ratio = 540/2000 = 0.27(which is fake/incorrect).

5. so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2(as real cds/borrow ratio below 0.2 based on above explained scenario)  which breaks the protocol main invariant which is  New Borrows cannot mint new stablecoin if cds/borrow ratio is below 0.2 and cds users cannot withdraw.

### Impact

omniChainData.cdsPoolValue    will always be bigger than actual/real omniChainData.cdsPoolValue. So the cds/borrow ratio will always be bigger than the actual/real cds/borrow ratio. In some cases , the cds/borrow’s real  ratio may become below 0.2 but the protocol will calculate above 0.2(so new stablecoin can be minted/ cds users can withdraw if cds/borrow ratio  is below 0.2.


### PoC

### Mitigation

whenover,  the function deposit(cdslib.sol)/ function withdrawUser(cdslib.sol) is called, omniChainData.downsideProtected  should be  deducted from omniChainData.cdsPoolValue.
