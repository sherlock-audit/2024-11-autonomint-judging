# `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is never reduced on cds withdrawal, leading to stuck collateral

### Summary

`omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is increased on cds deposit, [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L543-L546). However, it is not reduced on withdrawal, which means it is always inflated. As such, when a cds depositor withdraws collateral from a liquidation, the individual sum of the [shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L646) amount will never reach 100% of the collateral, leaving it stuck.

### Root Cause

When withdrawing cds, total available liquidation amount is not reduced.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Cds depositor deposits 1000 USDa and then withdraws, opting for liquidation. `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is left as 1000.
2. Another cds depositor deposits 1000 USDa.
3. Borrower deposits 1 ETH and borrows 800 USDa.
4. Price drops 20%.
5. Borrower is liquidated, and the cds depositor should earn all the collateral.
6. The cds depositor withdrawing will only get 50% of the collateral, as `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is infalted.

### Impact

Stuck collateral. Attacker can inflate `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` a lot so cds depositors receive close to no collateral.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Reduce total available liquidation amount when withdrawing cds.
