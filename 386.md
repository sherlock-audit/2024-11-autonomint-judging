# Missing totalAvailableLiquidationAmount update when cds owner withdraw.

### Summary

The missing update `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` in cds withdraw() function will cause that we use unexpected cds deposit to process the liquidation.

### Root Cause

When users deposit USDT/USDA as one cds owner, users can choose to opt in the liquidation to participate the liquidation. We will update [the global totalAvailableLiquidationAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L546) according to the users' input.

If there are some unhealthy positions, admin can make use of these `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` usda to liquidate these unhealthy borrowed position.

The problem is that if one cds owner withdraw his position, we should deduct the `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` according to this cds owner's liquidation amount.

For example:
1. Alice deposits 1000 USDT/USDA, and opt in the liquidation with liquidation amount 1000U.
2. Bob deposits 1000 USDT/USDA, and set `liquidate` to false, do not want to participate the liquidation.
3. Alice withdraw her position. Currently, the `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is still 1000 U.
4. Someone borrows some USDA and the position is unhealthy. 
5. Admin can still liquidate via `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount`. This is one unexpected behavior. Because bob does not want to participate with the liquidation.

```solidity
        if (params.liquidate) {
            ...
            omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount += params.liquidationAmount;
        }
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 1000 USDT/USDA, and opt in the liquidation with liquidation amount 1000U.
2. Bob deposits 1000 USDT/USDA, and set `liquidate` to false, do not want to participate the liquidation.
3. Alice withdraw her position. Currently, the `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is still 1000 U.
4. Someone borrows some USDA and the position is unhealthy. 
5. Admin can still liquidate via `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount`. This is one unexpected behavior. Because bob does not want to participate with the liquidation.


### Impact

Bob's funds are used to liquidate. 
1. If bob withdraw his position, this transaction may be reverted because there is not enough USDA.
2.If there is enough usda, bob can withdraw his position. But in the treasury, we have less USDA than expected, and there will be one part of liquidated collateral that nobody can redeem.

### Mitigation

Deduct the related remaining liquidation amount from `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` when cds owners withdraw their position.
