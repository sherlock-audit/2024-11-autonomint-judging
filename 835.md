# Anyone can inflate `downsideProtected` causing a DOS of deposit/withdraw in `CDS`

### Summary

The `updateDownsideProtected` function in `CDS.sol` being public allows anyone to manipulate the `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` calculations. This can lead to incorrect accounting of deposited funds and potential loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In `CDS.sol:830` the `updateDownsideProtected` function is declared as `public`, allowing any user to call it and arbitrarily increase the `downsideProtected` value. This, in turn, affects the calculations in `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` where `downsideProtected` is subtracted from `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Any user can call the `updateDownsideProtected` function with a large value for `downsideProtectedAmount`.
2. Then later when the `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` function gets called, indirectly through other functions when other users deposit or withdraw.
3. `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` subtracts the inflated `downsideProtected` value from `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, leading to an incorrect reduction in these values and in the worst case it could lead to underflow error which will DOS any deposit/withdraw operations from DCS.

### Impact

- Potential DOS of all deposit/withdraw operations in DCS.
- Potential loss of funds or profit because of the inaccurate `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` values.

### PoC

In the below code [CDS.sol:830](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829C1-L831C6) the `updateDownsideProtected` function is declared as `public`:

```solidity
  function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
      downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
  }
```

The `downsideProtected` value is used in the `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` function to update the values of  `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`:

```solidity
function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
    if (downsideProtected > 0) {
        totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
        totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
        downsideProtected = 0;
    }
}
```

Because anyone can increase the value of `downsideProtected`, it means that `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` can be manipulated and can even cause underflow errors if  `downsideProtected` is larger than their respective values.

`_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` is invoked both deposit and withdraw function thus this issue can cause complete DOS of deposit/withdraw operations in DCS and can potential lead to loss of funds due to inaccurate accounting.

### Mitigation

Change the visibility of the `updateDownsideProtected` function in `CDS.sol:830` from `public` to `private` or introduce appropriate access control mechanisms to restrict its usage.
