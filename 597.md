# Incorrect cumulative value calculation in cds deposit

### Summary

In cdsLib:deposit(), we calculate the cumulative value before we deduct the downsideProtected from the `omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount`.

### Root Cause

In [CDSLib.sol:489](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L489-L509), when users deposit in CDS, we will calculate the cumulative between the last Ether price and current Ether price.

The problem is that we calculate the cumulative value before we deduct the downsideProtected amount. This is incorrect, which will cause the incorrect cumulative value calculation.

For example:
1. Alice deposits 1000 USDT/USDA in cds in timestamp A.
2. Bob borrows USDA in timestampA + 100.
3. Ether price drops, and Bob withdraw his collateral in timestamp A + 200. Some downsideProtected amount(e.g. 200 USDA) is generated.
4. Cathy wants to deposit X USDT/USDT in cds in timestamp A + 300. In deposit, we will calculate the accrued cumulative value between timestamp A + 200 and timestamp A + 300 based on the total deposit amount. But the expected total cds deposit amount should be (1000 - 200), not 1000.
```solidity
        CDSInterface.CalculateValueResult memory result = calculateCumulativeValue(
            params.ethPrice,
            omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount,
            params.lastEthPrice,
            //params.fallbackEthPrice,
            omniChainData.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountinWei
        );
        ...
        if (omniChainData.downsideProtected > 0) {
            omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount -= omniChainData.downsideProtected;
            omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= omniChainData.downsideProtected;
            omniChainData.downsideProtected = 0;
        }
```

### Impact

The cumulative value calculation is incorrect. This will cause incorrect cds owners' withdraw amount. CDS owners may withdraw more or less amount than expected.
