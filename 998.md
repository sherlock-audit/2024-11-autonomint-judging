# In the Liquidation Type 1 process, Ether refunds are being sent to an incorrect recipient address

### Summary

In the Liquidation Type 1 process, Ether refunds are being sent to an incorrect [recipient address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint-bluenights004/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L303). Specifically, refunds should be directed to the admin user, who acts as the liquidation operator and is the legitimate recipient. However, the current implementation mistakenly sends the refund to the borrower’s address.

```Solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
302:         if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
303:             (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}(""); //@note wrong address 
304:             require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
305:         }
```

### Root Cause

When liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain is zero or cross-chain operations are unnecessary, the Ether refund is incorrectly sent to the borrower’s address instead of the admin’s address. This misdirection can result in the admin losing funds that should rightfully be refunded to them.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Here is the scenario
1. Execution of Liquidation Type 1: A loan is liquidated using Liquidation Type 1.
2. Zero Cross-Chain Amount: In this liquidation, liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain is zero, indicating that no Ether is needed for cross-chain operations.
3. Refund Process: Ether is intended to be refunded to the liquidator, which is the admin.
4. Incorrect Recipient Address: Due to a flaw in the code, the refund is mistakenly sent to the borrower’s address instead of the admin’s address.
5. Loss of Funds: As a result, the admin loses the funds that should have been refunded.

### Impact

The admin, who is responsible for executing the Liquidation Type 1 process, loses Ether refunds that should be rightfully sent to them.

### Mitigation

Update the recipient address in the refund logic to the admin’s address.
