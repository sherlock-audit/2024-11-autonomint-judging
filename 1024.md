# In reality borrowers will not receive Downside Protection in `BorrowLib::withdraw`

### Summary

The protocol guarantees downside protection of up to 20% for all depositors at the time of withdrawal. However, the implementation in the `BorrowLib::withdraw` function has a critical flaw. While the `downsideProtected` amount is calculated based on the user's deposited amount and subtracted from the total debt in global state variables, but in reality borrower do not get benefit of downside protection amount, as protocol do not subtract downside protection from borrower's debt at the time of actually transfer

### Root Cause

The `downsideProtected` amount is not properly subtracted during the repayment of debt to the treasury within the `BorrowLib::withdraw` function. This oversight renders the downside protection mechanism non-functional, preventing users from receiving the intended benefits.

```solidity
 bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
                    (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral
                );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The protocol must calculate the `downsideProtected` amount correctly when the Eth price falls by 20%. However, the calculated amount is not subtracted during the actual debt repayment process.


### External pre-conditions

The price of ETH value should be less than its value at the time of deposit by no more than 20%. This condition must be met for the user to be eligible for downside protection.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users do not receive downside protection: ultimately losing their more USDa token by paying more than the required debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

subtract downside protection from actual `transferFrom` value
