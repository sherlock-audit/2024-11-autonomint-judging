# Users can't actually redeem their abond for ETH in `redeemYields()`

### Summary

When a user has deposited ETH as collateral and repays it, he gets 50% of the ETH back and the rest of his ETH as abond, which he can redeem in `redeemYields()`.

The issue is that in `redeemYields()`, `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false)` is called and with the false parameter, it is decrementing `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` with the first param - `usdaToTransfer`.

What happens next is a revert, because nowhere in the protocol is actually `usdaGainedFromLiquidation` incremented or set with a positive value, so it is having the default value of zero, and as we know - when we try to decrement zero with a positive number, it is always going to result in a revert.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that we call [treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1005) in `redeemYields()`, but we do not call it anywhere with the second param set to true to increment it, thus resulting in an underflow and a revert.

Judging by the name of the function, it should have been added somewhere in the liquidation process, but I can only guess.

What I can say with 100% certainty is that calling `redeemYields()` will result in an underflow and revert every single time due to the invocation of `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false)` that is decrementing zero with a positive number.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User deposits collateral via `borrowing::depositTokens()` and takes a loan
2. User decides to repay his loan via `borrowing::withdraw()` and he receives 50% of his ETH that he deposited, as well as some abond tokens
3. User wants to redeem his abond via `redeemYields()`, but he can't due to the underflow caused from `treasury.updateUSDaGainedFromLiquidation(usdaToTransfer, false)`

### Impact

`redeemYields()` is uncallable resulting in abond tokens being irredeemable, which means that ETH deposited to Ionic can't be claimed back by the users, resulting in stucked funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either remove the function in `redeemYields()` causing the underflow, or add it somewhere where it increments the value, so that underflow can't happen.
