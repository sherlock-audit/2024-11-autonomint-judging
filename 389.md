# `lastEventTime` is not set during liquidate and is set before `calculateCumulativeRate` in the withdraw

### Summary

`calculateCumulativeRate` is invoked during withdraw, the problem is that the `lastEventTime` is set before the function is invoked. This will lead in situation where `cumulativeRate` will be not calculated correctly. Similar situation can be faced during liquidate.

### Root Cause

First problem that can be saw is during `withdraw`, where `lastEventTime` is not set correctly. It is set before the computation of `cumulativeRate`:

```solidity
        totalNormalizedAmount = result.totalNormalizedAmount;
        collateralRemainingInWithdraw = result.collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw = result.collateralValueRemainingInWithdraw;

        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);} // this should be after

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
        calculateCumulativeRate();
```

Next is in the liquidate, the `lastEventTime` is not set at all in the whole method:

```solidity
        if (user == address(0)) revert Borrow_MustBeNonZeroAddress(user);
        // Check whether the user address is admin address
        if (msg.sender == user) revert Borrow_CantLiquidateOwnAssets();

        // Call calculate cumulative rate fucntion to get interest
        calculateCumulativeRate();
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Incorrect Interest Calculation**: The `cumulativeRate` is not computed correctly for the current block due to:
  - Premature setting of `lastEventTime` during `withdraw`.
  - Absence of `lastEventTime` updates during `liquidate`.
- **Compounding Errors**: These errors persist and propagate, leading to incorrect interest values in subsequent operations.

### PoC

### Mitigation

To resolve these issues:

1. **Adjust `withdraw` Logic**:
   - Move the `lastEventTime` update to occur **after** the `calculateCumulativeRate` invocation:
     ```solidity
     calculateCumulativeRate();
     lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
     lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp); // Correct placement
     ```

2. **Update `liquidate` Logic**:
   - Ensure `lastEventTime` is updated within the `liquidate` method after invoking `calculateCumulativeRate`:
     ```solidity
     calculateCumulativeRate();
     lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp); // Ensure proper update
     ```

By implementing these changes, the protocol will ensure consistent and accurate handling of `cumulativeRate` across all scenarios.
