# Missing access controls bricks CDS deposits/withdraws and prevents liquidations

### Summary

In `CDS.sol` the `downsideProtected` state variable is used to keep track of the amount of downside protected for borrower's collateral from the CDS in the event the price of ETH decreases from the time of deposit.

In both `CDS::deposit` and `CDS::withdraw`, `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` is called to apply the downside provided to borrowers to the CDS pool, then reset the amount to 0:

```solidity
function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
@>            totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
@>            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }
```

If `downsideProetected` is ever larger than `totalCdsDepositedAmount` or `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, the transaction will revert via underflow.

`CDS::updateDownsideProtected` is missing access controls allowing an attacker to set the `downProtected` state variable to a value larger than `totalCdsDepositedAmount` or `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`:
```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```

Now any `CDS::deposit()` will revert preventing users from depositing into the CDS, and any CDS depositors that hasnâ€™t withdrawn will not be able to call `CDS::withdraw()`, permanently locking their funds.

The protocol will also not be able to liquidate using type 1 liquidations because the call to `CDS::getTotalCdsDepositedAmount` will revert due to underflow:

```solidity
function liquidationType1(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
...
        uint256 liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain = BorrowLib.getLiquidationAmountProportions(
                liquidationAmountNeeded,
@>          cds.getTotalCdsDepositedAmount(),
                omniChainData.totalCdsDepositedAmount - omniChainData.downsideProtected,
                cds.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount(),
                omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount
            );
...
```

### Root Cause

Missing access controls on `CDS::updateDownsideProtected`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker calls `pdateDownsideProtected()` setting `downsideProtected` to an amount larger than `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attack waits for users to deposit into the CDS
2. Attacker calls CDS::updateDownsideProtected() and sets the `downsideProtected` to an amount larger than `totalCdsDepositedAmount`
3. Now all CDS depositors will be unable to withdraw their funds and the protocol will be unable to liquidate borrowers using type 1 liquidations

### Impact

Loss of funds for CDS depositors that can't withdraw. Bad debt for the protocol since they can't liquidate borrowers. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access controls.
