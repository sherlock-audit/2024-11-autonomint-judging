# Token holder can repeatedly spend ABOND tokens due to incorrect state updates in transferFrom

### Summary
Critical vulnerability where token holders can effectively double-spend their ABOND tokens because transferFrom updates spender's state instead of token holder's state.

### Root Cause
```solidity
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState; // Incorrect 
// Should be:
userStates[from] = fromState;
```

[Abond_Token.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L165-L165)

### Internal pre-conditions
- Token holder has ABOND balance
- Spender has approval to spend tokens

### External pre-conditions
- None

### Attack Path
1. Token holder approves address A to spend 100 ABOND
2. A executes transferFrom for 100 ABOND to address B
3. Token holder's state remains unchanged
4. A's state is incorrectly debited
5. Token holder can approve and transfer same tokens again as their state wasn't updated

### Impact
Financial losses:
- Token holder can deplete protocol's ETH backing multiple times
- Each cycle allows spending original ETH backing amount
- For 10 ETH backing ($20,000):
  - First spend: $20,000 loss
  - Second spend: Additional $20,000 loss
  - Pattern repeatable until protocol's ETH reserves depleted
- Protocol could lose entire ETH reserves due to multiple users exploiting`

### Mitigation
Replace:
```solidity
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;
```
with:
```solidity
userStates[from] = fromState;
```
