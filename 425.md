# Users get loan less than expected during usda de-peg price

### Summary

users get loan less than expected during usda de-peg price 

### Root Cause

```solidity
tokensToLend = depositedAmount * ethPrice * LTV 
```
as we can see the protocol assumes usda price always is $1 but if usda price fall down $1 loan's worth become less than expected

### PoC

**Textual PoC:**
Let's assume LTV is 80%
userA deposits 1 ETH as collateral in Borrowing contract when ETH price is $1000
tokensToLend = 1 ETH * $1000 * 80% = 800 usda
and if usda price become $0.95 userA's loan's worth is $760 instead of $800 


### Impact

loss of funds for users

### Mitigation

Consider to check usda price when usda will be minted and set min and max price for that
