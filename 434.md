# `optionsRenewedTimeStamp` is not used during the calculation of downsideProtected

### Summary

`renewOptions` function is used to renew options with paying option fee. It is stated in the documentation of the method: 
```solidity
 /**
     * @dev renew the position by 30 days by paying usda.
     * The user will have 80% downside protection
     * @param index index of the position to renew
     */
```
But the `optionsRenewedTimeStamp` is not enforced during the downside protection.

### Root Cause

Users can renew options between the 15th and the 30 days of the deposit, this will `optionsRenewedTimeStamp` with 30 days from now on. But the problem is that this timestamp is not enforced in the calculation of `downsideProtection` and the protocol will suffer a lose of option fees. 

User will pay a option fee, so they can have downside protection after the first 30 days period, but user will have downside protection even if they don't pay it. On the other hand even users which doesn't paid this option fee will have downside protection.

### Mitigation
