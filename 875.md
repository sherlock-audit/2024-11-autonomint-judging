# there is no check for nonce duplication

### Summary

 in the contract borrow the function  **withDraw** takes  4 arguments two are used for signature verification   **odosAssembledData** and  **signature** and it will  try to verify that the signer is the admin the problem here is that anyone can use the previous  **signature** and **odosAssembledData*  to bypass as there is no check for nonce duplication so this means that anyone can call and withdraw   and make the **odosAssembledData**  to not revert when called in the  router 
   
`        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer();
