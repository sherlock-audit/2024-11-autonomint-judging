# Liquidation type 1 can cause loss of funds to admin due to wrong address ether recipient.

### Summary

There is a wrong [address recipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L303) of ether refund in liquidation type 1 process. Since the liquidation operator is an admin user, the refund from liquidation operation should go to the admin as they are the rightful recipient of refund.

```Solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
302:         if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
303:             (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}(""); //@audit wrong address recipient
304:             require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
305:         }
```

### Root Cause

Wrong address recipient of ether refund when liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0 or cross-chain operation is not needed. It should be admin address and not borrower address. This can cause lost of funds for the admin.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Liquidation Type 1 has been executed to liquidate a loan.
2. In this liquidation, the liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain is zero, therefore there is no need for ether to pay for cross-chain operation.
3. The ether will be refunded to the liquidator which is the admin.
4.  However, the address recipient is wrong which is designated to the borrower address.
5. The liquidator admin lost his funds.

### Impact

Lost of funds for the admin which should be the rightful recipient of ether refund as they are the executor of liquidation type 1 process
