# Incorrect global borrower count decrement in `BorrowLib.withdraw()` due to local chain validation

### Summary

`BorrowLib.withdraw()` incorrectly decrements the global number of borrowers by validating only local chain deposits. When a user with cross-chain positions withdraws from one chain, the global borrower count is decremented if their local deposit equals their local total deposits, despite having active positions on the other chain. This creates inconsistency in the cross-chain state management.

### Root Cause

In [`BorrowLib.sol:914`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L914-L917), the withdrawal logic uses local chain validation to make global state changes at the cross chain level:

```solidity
// update the global omnichain data
if (interfaces.treasury.getTotalDeposited(msg.sender) == depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) {
   --omniChainData.noOfBorrowers;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has deposits on both chains
2. At least one chain has a single deposit
3. The other chain has multiple active borrows

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User setup:

Optimism Chain:
- Deposit 10 ETH (Position 1)
- Deposit 5 ETH  (Position 2)
Total: 15 ETH

Mode Chain:
- Deposit 8 ETH  (Single Position)
Total: 8 ETH

2. Withdrawal on Mode:

// On Mode
```solidity
getTotalDeposited(user) == 8 ETH        // True
depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH == 8 ETH  // True
--omniChainData.noOfBorrowers           // Decrements despite Optimism active borrows
```

### Impact

1. State Inconsistency:
  - Inaccurate global borrower count
  - Misrepresentation of protocol metrics
  - Cross-chain state desynchronization
2. Protocol Operations:
  - Could affect protocol decisions based on cross chain borrower count
  - Misleading analytics and reporting
  - Potential impact on future governance decisions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement cross-chain position validation

```solidity
function withdraw() {
    // Check positions across all chains
    uint256 totalCrossChainPositions = interfaces.globalVariables
        .getTotalCrossChainPositions(msg.sender);
    
    // Only decrement if this is the last position across ALL chains
    if (totalCrossChainPositions == 1) {
        --omniChainData.noOfBorrowers;
    }
}
```
