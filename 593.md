# Arbitrary transfer from in the A bond token contract

***Summary:***
The [ERC-20 standard interface](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) specifies a transferFrom function, which can be used to transfer tokens between two specified accounts. In some implementations, the from address may be vulnerable to attacks that allow anyone to spend another user's token balance. As a result, a best practice is to ensure that the from address in a call to transferFrom is the msg.sender value, particularly when calling an ERC-20 implementation that you did not author using the require statement.

***POC:***
In 2018, a blockchain security research firm uncovered multiple undisclosed ERC-20 implementations that were vulnerable to the Arbitrary transferFrom vulnerability. These contracts did not properly check the allowance of tokens allotted to the message sender from the from address, allowing users to spend tokens held by any address with a balance.

The transfer from function in the A bond token contract deducts the value amount without checking that the sender is the valid from. This allows anyone to spend the tokens controlled by any account. 

***Mitigation:***
```diff
function transferFrom( 
     address from, 
     address to, 
     uint256 value 
 ) public override returns (bool) { 
+    // check the sender is the valid from.
+    require(msg.sender == from, "Access control issue");

     // check the input params are non zero 
     require(from != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User"); 
  
     // get the sender and receiver state 
     State memory fromState = userStates[from]; 
     State memory toState = userStates[to]; 
  
     // update receiver state 
     toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value)); 
     userStates[to] = toState; 
  
     // update sender state 
     fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value)); 
     userStates[msg.sender] = fromState; 
  
     // transfer abond 
     super.transferFrom(from, to, value); 
     return true; 
 } 
```
In the corrected code, the sender being the valid from address is enforced before allowing the transfer of tokens.
