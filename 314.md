# Borrowers will get more normalizedAmount than expected.

### Summary

Borrowers will get more normalizedAmount than expected because we don't update the `calculateCumulativeRate` timely.

### Root Cause

In [Borrowing:227](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L227C9-L227C28), borrowers will borrow usda via depositing Ethers.

When we borrow usda, we will normalize the borrowers' debt based on latest cumulative value. The problem is that we calculate the debt `normalizedAmount` at first and then update the cumulative rate. This will cause borrowers will get one larger `normalizedAmount` than expected. It means that borrowers will pay more borrow interest than expected.

```solidity
        uint256 normalizedAmount = calculateNormAmount(tokensToMint, libParams.lastCumulativeRate);
```
```solidity
    function depositTokens(
        BorrowDepositParams memory depositParam
        // Function 0 --> borrow deposit.
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(0)) {
        totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
            BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
                LTV, // 80 --> 80%
                APR, // 50 --> 5%
                lastCumulativeRate,
                totalNormalizedAmount,
                exchangeRate, // get the exchange rate according to the oracle.
                ethPrice, // current ether price.
                lastEthprice
            ),
            depositParam,
            Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options),
            assetAddress
        );

 @>       calculateCumulativeRate();
    }
```
