# Missing slippage protection for `depositTokens()`

## Summary

The `borrowing.sol` contract provides `depositTokens()` function to deposit collateral like wrsEth, weETH, ETH and receives stablecoin usda. However, these collaterals are volatile and users could not receive usda than expected.

## Root Cause

Borrowing.depositTokens(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L226) is missing slippage protection.

## Internal pre-conditions

## External pre-conditions

## Attack Path

## Impact

Loss of assest for borrowers.

## Mitigation

Implement a slippage control that allows the users to revert if the amount they received is less than the amount they expected.
