# USDA cannot be deposited in the CDS until the `usdtLimit` is reached

### Summary

Per the [audit documentation](https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/stablecoin-re-deemability), 

> The dCDS module will be accepting USDT also as a %age of deposits in our dCDS module such that the the total proportion of USDT in our protocol never exceeds 75% of the total deposits.

This  invariant is broken because while depositing into the CDS contract, this invariant is broken

### Root Cause

[CDS.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L438-L446)

As shown below, until the `usdtLimit` has been reached, only USDT can be deposited in the CDS

```solidity
File: CDSLib.sol
420:     function deposit(
421:         CDSInterface.DepositUserParams memory params,
422:         mapping(address => CDSInterface.CdsDetails) storage cdsDetails,
423:         CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces
424:     ) public returns (CDSInterface.DepositResult memory) {
425:         // totalDepositingAmount is usdt and usda
426:         uint256 totalDepositingAmount = params.usdtAmount + params.usdaAmount;

////             ..............
436: 
437:         // Check whether the usdt limit is reached or not
438:  @>     if (omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow < params.usdtLimit) {
439:             // If the usdtAmountDepositedTillNow and current depositing usdt amount is lesser or
440:             // equal to usdtLimit
441:             if (
442:                 (omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow +
443:                     params.usdtAmount) <= params.usdtLimit
444:             ) {
445:                 // Check the totalDepositingAmount is usdt amount // @audit MED: before the USDT limit is exceeded, the deposit must be fully USDT, the problem is that this breaks invariant that says  USDT in dCDS must not exceed 75% total deposit
446:    @>          if (params.usdtAmount != totalDepositingAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_NeedsUSDTOnly();
447:             } else {
448:                 revert CDSInterface.CDS_SurplusUSDT();
449:             }
450:         } else {


```
This means that the CDS will consist of 100% USDT until the  `usdtLimit` has been reached. Thus breaking the 75% invariant mentioned above.


Also worthy of note is that, user's who want to deposit USDa cannot until the USDT limit is reached thus leading to a DOS for users who intend to deposit USDa.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- USDA cannot be deposited until USDT limit is reached thus leading to a DOS for users who want to deposit USDA
- Core protocol invariant is broken

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider
- allowing users to deposit USDa even when the usdt limit has not been reached
-  implementing the 75% invariant in CDS module.
