# ETH is wrongly sent to the borrower when `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0` during liquidation and

### Summary

During liquidation, when the amount if `usda` to get [to get from other chains is zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L302-L305) (i.e `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` is 0), the value of ETH that is suppose to be sent with cross chain transaction is wrongly returned to the borrower instead of the liquidator


### Root Cause


```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
302:         if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
303:    @>       (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
304:             require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
305:         }
```

- This leads loss of funds for the protocol as positions can only be liquidated by the protocol
- Borrowers can also use this to block liquidation as explained in the _Attack Path_ section

### Mitigation

Modify the `borrowLiquidation.liquidationType1(...)` function as shown below

```diff
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
302:         if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
303:      -      (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
303:      +      (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: msg.value}("");
304:             require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
305:         }
```
