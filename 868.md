# Insufficient `strikePrice` validation in borrowing.deposit may prevent users from withdrawing their collateral

### Summary

When users withdraw from borrowing.sol the amount of collateral they have to receive is calculated through the `calculateCollateralToReturn` function. The issue is that it is possible for the function to revert when the selected strike price is lower than the current ETH price, preventing users from withdrawing their collateral.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.calculateCollateralToReturn the following calculation is performed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L477-L487
```solidity
        uint128 depositedAmountvalue = (params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * params.depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / params.ethPrice;
        uint128 collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
        // If the health is greater than 1
        if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000) {
            // If the ethPrice is higher than deposit ethPrice,call withdrawOption in options contract
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
            // increment the difference between collatearla to  return and deposited amount in collateralRemainingInWithdraw
            collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralToReturn;
```

As we can see, if `collateralToReturn` is higher than `params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH` the function will underflow. This will happen if the `strikePrice` set by the user is lower than the ETH price at the time of the deposit. If that occurs `calculateCollateralToReturn` will revert, preventing users from withdrawing their assets.

Such a scenario can occur when the price of ETH experiences sudden increases.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User sends a transaction where they deposit to borrowing.sol.
2. At the time of which they send the transaction the price of ETH is 3900 USD, thus they set the `strikePrice` to 3925 USD.
3. The transaction does not get executed immediately perhaps due to network traffic or an MEV attack, and while the transaction is in the mempool the price of ETH increases to 3950 USD.
4. Now when the transaction gets executed the ETH price is 3950 USD, but the deposit strike price is only 3925 USD.
5. ETH's price continues to grow and reaches 4000 USD.
6. The user attempts to withdraw, however they are unable to as `calculateCollateralToReturn` reverts.

### Impact

Users may be unable to withdraw their assets.

### PoC

This is a simple function that shows why `calculateCollateralToReturn` will revert in the Attack Path provided above:

```solidity
    function testCollateralToReturnMath() public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 depositAmount = 1000e18;
        uint256 ethPriceAtDeposit = 3950e2;
        uint256 strikePrice = 3925e2;
        uint256 ethPriceAtWithdrawal = 4000e2;

        uint256 a = ((depositAmount * ethPriceAtDeposit) /
            ethPriceAtWithdrawal) +
            (depositAmount * ethPriceAtWithdrawal - depositAmount * strikePrice) /
            ethPriceAtWithdrawal;
        return a;//1006250000000000000000
        //this is more than 1000e18, therefore it will underflow
    }
```

### Mitigation

When depositing into borrowing it should be validated that the strike price is not lower than the current ETH price.
