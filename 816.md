# `calculateRatio` returns ratio in incorrect decimals

### Summary

When users deposit into borrowing.sol `calculateRatio` is called to check whether the CDS has enough funds to give downside prortection to borrowers. The issue is that it currently returns the ratio in incorrect decimals, causing the ratio validation to always pass.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.calculateRatio here is how the ratio calculations are performed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L218
```solidity
        uint64 ratio = uint64((currentCDSPoolValue * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / currentVaultValue);
```

The result has the following decimals:
-currentCDSPoolValue: 18 decimal
-CUMULATIVE_PRECISION: 7 decimal
-currentVaultValue: 20 decimal

Therefore, the ratio will be of 5 decimals.

The issue is that in BorrowLib.deposit it is compared to a value of 4 decimals:

This is problematic as the return value of `calculateRatio` will be higher than the necessary amount in almost all cases, making the validation insufficient. Furthermore, in the developer comments in `calculateRatio` it is stated that it should be multiplied by 1e6 instead of 1e7:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L218

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Deposits are made to borrowing.sol.
2. The ratio validation is insufficient and it is not detected that there are not enough funds in CDS.
3. As a result, deposits which are not downside protected are successfully finalized.

### Impact

The ratio validation is insufficient and deposits which are not downside protected by CDS can be made.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The return value of `calculateRatio` should have 4 decimal places, instead of 5.
