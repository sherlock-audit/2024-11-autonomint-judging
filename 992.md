# Front-running and back-running attacks in approveTokens

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L588-L608
The primary vulnerability in this function is the risk of front-running. An attacker can monitor pending transactions and see when approveTokens is called. By submitting their own approve transaction with a higher amount before the original transaction is mined, they can effectively increase the approval limit and transfer more funds than intended.
# Vulnerability Details
Race conditions could arise if multiple transactions are interacting with the same token and approval addresses concurrently. This could potentially lead to inconsistent states and unintended approvals being set.
The approveTokens function allows for approval of tokens to be set. If multiple transactions are trying to approve the same token to the same spender address concurrently, there could be a race condition.

Specifically, if two different transactions are trying to approve the same spender address at the same time, the approvals might overwrite each other, leading to unintended behavior. For example, one transaction might approve a certain amount of tokens to a spender, and another transaction might unintentionally reset that approval before the first transaction is mined.

# Impact
A front-running attacker could exploit this by submitting a transaction that sets a large approval before the legitimate userâ€™s transaction can be processed, thus gaining control over more tokens than intended.
This can lead to an attacker controlling more funds than authorized by the original transaction, effectively bypassing the approval mechanism.
# PoC
1. Initial Setup
Assume the contract allows anyone to call the approveTokens function for token approval.
There is a legitimate user (User A) who intends to approve a certain amount of tokens (1000 USDT) for a spender (Spender A).
An attacker (Attacker) is watching the blockchain for pending approval transactions.
2. Scenario: Front-running Attack
Step 1: User A creates a transaction to approve 1000 USDT for Spender A.

```solidity

// User A initiates a transaction to approve 1000 USDT to Spender A
treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, spenderA, 1000);
```
Step 2: The transaction from User A enters the mempool and is waiting to be mined. Meanwhile, Attacker observes the transaction in the mempool.

Step 3: Attacker front-runs User A's transaction by submitting a transaction to approve a much larger amount (e.g., 10000 USDT) for the same spenderA before User A's transaction gets mined.

```solidity

// Attacker front-runs by submitting their own approval for 10000 USDT to Spender A
treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, spenderA, 10000);
```
Step 4: Attacker's transaction is mined before User A's transaction. The approval amount for Spender A is now 10000 USDT instead of 1000 USDT, allowing the attacker to control more tokens.

Step 5: The legitimate approval from User A is effectively ignored or overridden by the larger approval from the Attacker. The attacker can now spend more tokens than intended by the legitimate user.

3. Scenario: Back-running Attack
This attack works similarly but involves the Attacker waiting for User A's transaction to be mined, and then they submit their own approval to modify the approval amount or the spender address.

Step 1: User A approves 1000 USDT to Spender A.

```solidity

treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, spenderA, 1000);
```
Step 2: The transaction is mined, and the approveTokens function now allows spenderA to spend 1000 USDT.

Step 3: The Attacker submits a transaction immediately after the approval to modify the approval amount, e.g., increasing the allowance to 10000 USDT, which is a larger amount than User A intended.

```solidity

treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa, spenderA, 10000);
```
Step 4: The Attacker's transaction overwrites the previous approval, allowing the attacker to control a larger number of tokens.
# Recommendations
Use Nonces for Approvals: Instead of blindly setting approvals, require the transaction to include a nonce or use a unique identifier that increments with each approval request. This ensures that each approval transaction is uniquely tied to a specific state, preventing race conditions.

Implement Approval Limits: Instead of allowing arbitrary approval amounts, set maximum limits or allow for approvals only in specific scenarios. This reduces the risk of malicious approvals.

Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern: Ensure that the approval mechanism interacts with external contracts (like the token contract) only after any state changes or checks have been finalized. This prevents front-running by malicious actors.

Re-entrancy Guards: Although this doesn't directly address the approval issue, ensure that re-entrancy guards are in place for external calls in sensitive areas like token approvals
