# Signatures are replayable

### Summary

There is no mechanism in the current implementation of `_verify()` function to prevent signature replay. This means that user will be able to call the withdraw function again with the same nonce and signature.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L878-L917)

The `borrowing.withdraw()` function does not store used signatures, in only checks that it was signed by admin:
```solidity
function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
        // check is _toAddress in not a zero address and isContract address
        if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);

   >>>  if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer();    <<<
        // Get the depositor details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
        // Get the exchange rate for a collateral and eth price
        (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[getBorrowingResult.depositDetails.assetName]);

        // check if borrowerIndex in BorrowerDetails of the msg.sender is greater than or equal to Index
        if (getBorrowingResult.totalIndex >= index) {
            _withdraw(
                toAddress,
                index,
                odosAssembledData,
                uint64(ethPrice),
                exchangeRate,
                uint64(block.timestamp)
            );
        } else {
            // revert if user doens't have the perticular index
            revert Borrow_InvalidIndex();
        }
    }
```

Although `CDS.withdraw()` has a `nonce` field, user can call function with the same nonce and use the signature again, because `nonce` never incremented internally, but provided by user.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Signatures are replayable, allowing to call `withdraw()` many times, not once as intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `usedNonce` mapping.
Implement an automatic `nonce` counter at the contract level.
