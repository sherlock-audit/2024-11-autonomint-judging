# missing  `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` update in `liquidationType2()`  can lead to loss of CDS depositor who opt in for liquidation

### Summary

During the liquidation of a position using `liquidationType2()`, the `omnichainData` is not updated at all (most notably `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations`)

The effect is not so obvious but it is a big problem because the `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` is critical for CDS depositors who opt in for liquidation during withdrawals. user will not receive liquidation collateral from liquidation because the for loop may not run as explained in the POC section

```solidity
File: CDSLib.sol
609:     function withdrawUser(
610:         CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
611:         CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,

//////          .........
624:         } else {
625:             uint128 weETHAmount;
626:             uint128 rsETHAmount;
627:             uint128 weETHAmountInETHValue;
628:             uint128 rsETHAmountInETHValue;
629:             uint128 collateralToGetFromOtherChain;
630:             uint128 totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH;
631: 
632:             uint128 liquidationIndexAtDeposit = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationindex; // index at deposit
633:             // If the number of liquidations is greater than or equal to liquidationIndexAtDeposit
634:             if (
635:     @>          params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations >=
636:                 liquidationIndexAtDeposit
637:             ) {
638:                 // Loop through the liquidations that were done after user enters
639:     @>          for (uint128 i = (liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1); i <= params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations; i++) {
640:                     uint128 liquidationAmount = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount; // available liq amt

### Root Cause

The problem is that if a user has deposited into the CDS and opted for liquidation,  not updating the `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` means that the `for` loop on L639 causing depositor to miss out on liquidation 

```solidity
File: CDS.sol
279:     function withdraw(
280:         uint64 index,
281:         uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue, // 1e11

/////               ...................
294: 
295:   @>    cdsDepositDetails.withdrawed = true;

```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- CDS depositors who opted for liquidation can miss out on some liquidation benefits, breaking core protocol functionality leading to a leak of value
- also, depositors who opt in for liquidation will be eligible for liquidatiion collateral from liquidations prior to their deposit thereby diluting the available liquidation collateral available for users from previous liquidation indexes

### PoC

- Alice deposits into CDS and opts for liquidation at `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` = 0
-  `liquidationType2()` is used to liquidate a Bobs position
- Alice calls `CDS::withdraw()` but the `for` loop is skipped assuming liquidations have not happened since Alice deposited thus causing her to miss out on liquidation collateral despite opting for liquidation

### Mitigation

- Consider modifying the `liquidationType2()` function to increment `liquidationType2()`
- Also, in the `liquidationType2()`, ensure call `setOmnichainData()` at the end of the function execution
