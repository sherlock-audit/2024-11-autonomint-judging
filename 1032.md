# The absence of proper access control in the `updateDownsideProtected` function exposes the protocol to potential malicious actions.

### Summary

The updateDownsideProtected function in the CDS contract can be called by anyone:
```solidity 
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```
This function modifies the downsideProtected state variable, meaning that any user can call it and set the downsideProtected value to a malicious amount. Since the downsideProtected value is always increasing, it cannot be reduced. If an attacker calls this function and sets downsideProtected to the maximum value of uint256, it cannot be reset, effectively locking the contract.

As a result, the CDS contract's main functionalities, such as deposit and withdrawal, will fail. This is because these functions rely on the _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount function, which will revert due to the excessive value in downsideProtected, causing the contract to be "DoSed" (denial of service) indefinitely.

### Attack Path

An attacker could call the `updateDownsideProtected` function and set the `downsideProtected` value to the maximum value of `uint256`. 
Once this occurs, the deposit and withdraw functions will no longer function, as the excessively high `downsideProtected` value will cause the contract to fail whenever these functions are executed. 
This effectively renders the contract unusable indefinitely.

### Impact

An attacker can permanently cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the core functions of the CDS contract, such as deposit and withdraw, by setting the `downsideProtected` value to the maximum value of `uint256`.
This would prevent these functions from operating, effectively locking the funds in the contract and making them inaccessible indefinitely.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should implement proper access control in the updateDownsideProtected function to ensure that only authorized parties can modify the downsideProtected value
