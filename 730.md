# Lack of expiry in signatures can lead to hoarding signatures for a profitable `CDS:withdraw` in future

### Summary

The [CDS::_verify](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L878) function is used to verify the signature provided by the protocol for a permissioned activity.
This function is called in [`CDS::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L279) and by borrowing contract's `withDraw` function via [`CDS::verify`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L864)
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint64 index,
        uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
        if (!_verify(FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW, excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, "0x", signature)) revert CDS_NotAnAdminTwo();
```
```solidity
    function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
        // check is _toAddress in not a zero address and isContract address
        if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);

        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer(); 
```
However, there is no expiry on the signature, this encourages hoarding of signatures for future use where the cumulative rate is not in favour.

### Root Cause

In [CDS.sol:865](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L864), verify function does not have a deadline parameter in the signature.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker asks for a `CDS::withdraw` signature from protocol.
2. But the attacker decides not to use it, instead attacker hoards it for future use, if a time comes where the global cumulative value is low, attacker can use the `excessProfitCumulativeValue` for his own profit.

### Impact

1. Loss of funds for the protocol as attacker is able to withdraw at enchanced `excessProfitCumulativeValue`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Recommended to Implement signature expiry mechanism
