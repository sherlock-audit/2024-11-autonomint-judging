# `lastCumulativeRate` is incorrectly calculated due to wrong update of the `lastEventTime`

### Summary

`lastEventTime` plays a crucial role in the `lastCumulativeRate` calculations. It needs to be updated on every user action after `lastCumulativeRate` is calculated. However, on `_withdraw`, `lastEventTime` is updated before `calculateCumulativeRate` is called, which leads to inaccurate calculations for `lastCumulativeRate`.

### Root Cause

The `calculateCumulativeRate` function calculates the time interval between user's actions with the protocol, using the difference between the current timestamp (block.timestamp) and `lastEventTime`.
```js
   function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        // If there is no borrowers in the protocol
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            // current cumulative rate is same as ratePeSec
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Find time interval between last event and now
            uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            //calculate cumulative rate
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
`calculateCumulativeRate` is called in [_withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L701-L704), but the problem is that `lastEventTime` is updated before the `lastCumulativeRate` is calculated, resetting the elapsed time since the last protocol interaction and the actual `timeInterval`.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

 The `lastCumulativeRate` is wrongly calculated resulting in the borrower's debt miscalculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `lastEventTime` should be updated after the `calculateCumulativeRate` function call.
