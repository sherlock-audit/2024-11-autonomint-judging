# Volatility parameter manipulation allows misspricing of options

### Summary

When a borrower deposits collateral in order to borrower USDa, they also purchase a call option that gives them positive exposure to price increases in their collateral. The protocol prices these options in Options::calculateOptionPrice():

One of the factors that goes into the pricing of options is the `volatility` (historical price volatility of ETH). According to the README, the volatility will be calculated via an off chain mechanism and then passed into `depositTokens()` function. 

The problem is that the protocol assumes all deposits will be made via their frontend, where they'll be able to pass in the correct eth volatility. However, a malicious user can call `Borrowing::depositTokens()` functions directly from the smart contract and pass in a `volatility` that allows them to receive the same option for a lower option fee. This misprices the risk of the options causing losses for dCDS depositors.

### Root Cause

Malicious borrowers can call `Borrowing.depositTokens()` directly via the smart contract and pass in any `volatility` they want.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The CDS pool value must be at least 20% of the collateral vault value, otherwise borrowing isn't allowed. 

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Instead of using the protocol’s frontend—which would enforce a correct volatility value—the attacker directly interacts with the Borrowing::depositTokens() smart contract function.
2. The attacker provides an advantageous volatility parameter to reduce the cost of the call option in their deposit.
3. Because the option fee is priced too low, the attacker gains a higher amount of “positive price exposure” at a discount.
4. If the collateral’s price rises, the underpriced call option yields outsized returns for the attacker.
5. The incorrect volatility data causes the protocol to collect insufficient fees, transferring risk and potential losses to the dCDS depositors who back the system.

### Impact

The misspriced risk of the options leads to losses for dCDS depositors since they are the ones funding the options.

### Mitigation

Use EIP 712 like you're doing in `Borrowing::withDraw()` and sign the deposit off chain with the correct volatility:

```solidity
function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
@>        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
        // check is _toAddress in not a zero address and isContract address
        if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);

@>        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer();
