# Critical Price Input Vulnerability in USDT Redemption Mechanism in CDS::reedemUSDT

### Summary

A severe security flaw exists in the CDS contract's redeemUSDT function, enabling malicious actors to execute price manipulation attacks. The vulnerability allows attackers to extract excessive USDT from the treasury by exploiting unverified price inputs for USDa and USDT tokens.

Note: Both the tokens USDa and USDT are stable coin and are peg with $1. But here, the manipulation of these tokens prices can be done by attacker.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of user-provided price inputs (`usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice`) in the exchange rate calculation, without any validation or use of a trusted price oracle. And on top of that, there is not a single check in the whole flow to check whether the user input prices are correct according to the actual current market or not.

Flow: [CDS::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506) --> [CDSLib::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L382)

```solidity
    function redeemUSDT(
          uint128 usdaAmount,
@>        uint64 usdaPrice,
@>        uint64 usdtPrice
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(6)) {
        
@->         burnedUSDaInRedeem = CDSLib.redeemUSDT(
            Interfaces(
                treasury,
                globalVariables,
                usda,
                usdt,
                borrowing,
                CDSInterface(address(this))
            ),
            burnedUSDaInRedeem,
            usdaAmount,
            usdaPrice,
            usdtPrice
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

A Attacker should have some USDa tokens, in order to execute this attack. See the example in PoC.


### Attack Path

1. Malicious actor identifies the unprotected price inputs
2. Prepares transaction with intentionally manipulated price parameters
3. Exploits the exchange rate calculation to maximize USDT output
4. Executes redemption with minimal USDa for maximum USDT return
5. Can perform multiple iterations to systematically drain treasury reserves

### Impact

The attacker will drain USDT from the treasury contract, causing a huge loss of protocol and its trusted users.


### PoC

Example and Impact -> 
- calculate the USDT:USDa amount formula in [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L404) ->

```solidity
uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```

Calculation of the above formula with actual numbers, where the attacker is doing manipulation in input param of [CDS::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506)  ->
- usdaAmount = 100e6 , usdaPrice = 100e6 , usdtPrice = 1e6
- manipulated calculations -> (100e6 * 100e6) / 1e6 =  10000e6

- so here attacker gave (burned) his 100 USDa tokens only and in return, he got back 10000 USDT from the [treasury](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L408), whereas in reality he was supposed to get 100e6 USDT tokens only because as we know USDa and USDT are stablecoin peg to $1. The attacker can do this operation multiple times and drain all USDT from the treasury contract


### Mitigation

Implementation of a secure price oracle system (such as Chainlink) is essential to prevent price manipulation. This would replace the current user-input mechanism with verified, market-accurate price data.
