# Incorrect Approval for Token Transfer in `transferFundsToGlobal` Causes Potential Transaction Failures

## Summary

In the `transferFundsToGlobal` function within `Treasury.sol` contract, there is a misalignment between the token approval amount and the intended transfer amount for `wrseth`. The function mistakenly uses the approval amount intended for `weeth`, which may result in failed transactions or unintended behavior during fund transfers.

## Vulnerability Details

The issue lies in the [approval](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L782-L783) process for `wrseth` within the loop. Instead of approving `transferAmounts[2]` (intended for wrseth), the code approves `transferAmounts[1]` (intended for weeth). This discrepancy creates an inconsistency in the approval and transfer logic, as shown below:
```js
if (i == 2) {
    if (!ITokenC(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) 
        revert ApprovalFailed();
    ITokenC(assetAddress).withdraw(transferAmounts[2]);
}
```
The incorrect approval amount `(transferAmounts[1])` causes failures when `transferAmounts[1] < transferAmounts[2]`.

## Impact

The function fails when the approved amount is insufficient for the intended transfer.

## Recommendation

Update the approval logic to match the intended transfer amount for `wrseth`:
```js
if (i == 2) {
    if (!ITokenC(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[2])) 
        revert ApprovalFailed();
    ITokenC(assetAddress).withdraw(transferAmounts[2]);
}
```
