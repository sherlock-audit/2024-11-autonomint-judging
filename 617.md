# Liquidated position by liquidation type 2 can be withdrawn

### Summary

Missing update key variables in liquidation type 2 will cause users can withdraw their liquidated position.

### Root Cause

If one borrow position is unhealthy, admin can liquidate this position via [liquidation type 2.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L324). 

The problem is that we lack update some key variables, e.g. `depositDetail.liquidated`. This will cause one liquidated borrow position may have the chance to be withdrawn.

For example:
1. Alice borrows USDA in timestamp A.
2. Ether price drops.
3. Admin liquidates Alice's borrow position in timestamp A + 100. After this, Alice should never withdraw her borrow position.
4. Ether price increases. Alice can withdraw her position.
```solidity
    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice borrows USDA in timestamp A.
2. Ether price drops.
3. Admin liquidates Alice's borrow position in timestamp A + 100. After this, Alice should never withdraw her borrow position.
4. Ether price increases. Alice can withdraw her position.

### Impact

Liquidated position by the liquidation type 2 may still be withdrawn by the borrower.

### Mitigation

In liquidation type 2, update `depositDetail.liquidated` and some other key parameters.
