# Incorrect totalAvailableLiquidationAmount update in liquidationType1

### Summary

When we liquidate one position, we will add all cdsProfits into the totalAvailableLiquidationAmount. This is incorrect, because cdsProfits belong to all cds owners.

### Root Cause

In [borrowLiquidation.sol:liquidationType1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L250), when admin liquidates one borrow position, we will use the cds deposit amount to cover the debt. After that, the `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` will be deducted because we use some cds deposit amount to cover the debt.

CDS owners will gain downsideProtected amount, so the actual deducted amount will be less than the total debt. The problem is that cdsProfits belongs to the whole cds owners, including cds owners who do not opt in the liquidation process. This will cause the `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is larger than expected.

```solidity
        omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount -= liquidationAmountNeeded - cdsProfits;
```
