# Option expiry time does not work

### Summary

The missing check option expiry time in borrowing will cause that borrowers can pay less option fee than expected.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing:226](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L226), borrowers can borrow USDa via depositing Ether and borrowers need to pay 30 days option fees.

Once the option is expiry, the borrowers need to renew their option to extend the option period via paying extra option fees.

The problem is that when borrowers withdraw their collateral, we miss the check about the option's expiry. This will cause that  borrowers don't need to renew their option and cds owners will lose some expected option fees.

```solidity
    function renewOptions(uint64 index) external payable {
        if (
            !BorrowLib.renewOptions(
                Interfaces(
                    treasury,
                    globalVariables,
                    usda,
                    abond,
                    cds,
                    options
                ),
                index
            )
        ) revert Borrow_RenewFailed();
    ...
}
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice borrows some USDa in timestamp A.
2. After 40 days, Alice can withdraw her collateral directly. Then cds owners will lose 10 days' option fees.

### Impact

CDS owners will lose some expected option fees.

### Mitigation

Add one check in borrowing:withdraw.
