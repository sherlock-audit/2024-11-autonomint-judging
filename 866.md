# Vulnerability in Chainlink Price Feed Handling in MasterPriceOracle:_price() Lack of MinPrice Check

## Issue Summary
The Chainlink aggregator provides a built-in circuit breaker to handle extreme fluctuations in asset prices. If the price drops below a predefined threshold, it returns a "minPrice" value. This feature aims to prevent the oracle from reporting highly volatile or erroneous prices. However, certain protocols, such as Venus on BSC during the LUNA crash, have failed to implement a check for this minPrice, which can lead to significant vulnerabilities.

When the price falls below the minimum threshold (minAnswer), the Chainlink oracle continues to return this minPrice instead of the actual market price. As a result, borrowers may use this inflated price to deposit collateral and borrow more than they should, creating the risk of accumulating bad debt in the protocol. The same vulnerability has been observed in the ETH/USD price feed on Optimism, which returns a minAnswer of `1000000000`.

## Root Cause
In the current implementation of the [MasterPriceOracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L80C13-L91C61) contract, there is no check to validate if the returned price is within the acceptable min/max range. If the oracle returns a price below the minPrice, the contract does not revert or take corrective action, leaving the protocol exposed to the risk of collateral mispricing.

## Preconditions

### Internal:
- The contract uses Chainlink's price feed for asset pricing.

### External:
- The price of the token drops below the specified minPrice threshold in the Chainlink aggregator.

## Exploit Path

1. The price of the token falls below the predetermined minPrice.
2. The Chainlink oracle continues to report the minPrice.
3. An attacker deposits collateral based on the inflated price (minPrice).
4. The attacker borrows a larger amount than what the collateral is actually worth.
5. The protocol ends up with bad debt as the borrowed amount exceeds the value of the collateral.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows malicious actors or even inadvertent users to borrow more than their collateral's true value. This leads to potential insolvency or bad debt accumulation within the protocol, risking a substantial loss of funds.

## Proof of Concept
No proof of concept provided. However, the scenario would play out by following the exploit path outlined above.

## Recommended Mitigation
To safeguard against this issue, it is essential to verify that the returned price from Chainlink's oracle is within the acceptable min/max range before proceeding with any borrowing or collateralization actions. The check can be implemented as follows:

```solidity
require(answer >= minPrice && answer <= maxPrice, "invalid price");
```
