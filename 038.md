# user can make protocol to not catch upside after withdraw

### Summary

There is no validation for signature that user uses on withdraw for `index`, and `msg.sender`

### Root Cause
In withdraw function signature and odos data passed to cds contract
```solidity
    function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
        // check is _toAddress in not a zero address and isContract address
        if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);

-->        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer();
        // Get the depositor details

```

E.x. there are two positions. E.x.there is upside - 1 wrsETH after first withdraw and 2 wrsEth after second withdraw. Target for odos swap is TREASURY from tests.
Everything goes normal user uses 1 signature for first withdrawal - 1 wrsETH exchange for 1000 udst to treasury
Everything goes normal user uses second signature for second withdrawal - 2 wrsETH exchange for 2000 udst to treasury

Attacker uses first signature for second withdrawal 1 wrsETH exchange for 1000 udst, but upside left - `2 wrsETH - 1 wrsETH=1wrsETH` left unaccounting. Which means some holders will not receive their stake which leads to depeging as the point of protocol to catch upside and distribute correctly

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

use odos data from 1 withdrawal and use it on another withdrawal

### Impact

holders will not receive their stake which leads to depeging as the point of protocol to catch upside and distribute correctly

### PoC


### Mitigation
index, should be included in signature validation and msg.sender so other users could not use it
```diff
    function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
        // check is _toAddress in not a zero address and isContract address
        if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress)) revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);

-        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer();
+        if (!cds.verify(odosAssembledData, signature, index, msg.sender)) revert Borrow_NotSignedByEIP712Signer();

```
