# Misalignment Between Withdrawal and Liquidation Thresholds Leads To Premature Liquidations.

### Summary

In the `BorrowLib.sol:withdraw` There is a check if the `borrowingHealth` is less than `8000` for the transaction to revert, with this `borrowingHealth` with precisely `8000` is allowed to go through this also contradict the natspec which says `// Check the health is grater thsn 0.8 ` or `8000`.

Next in the `borrowLiquidation.sol:liquidationType1` the ratio is checked for liquidation to occur.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L186-L191
This creates a critical overlap where position at `8000` are eligible for withdrawal and also liquidatable.

### Root Cause

In [BorrowLib.sol:819-822](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L819-L822), the condition to revert only checks if borrowingHealth < 8000. This allows transactions with borrowingHealth == 8000 to pass, contradicting the NatSpec that specifies health should be greater than 0.8 (or 8000).
In [borrowLiquidation.sol:186-191](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L186-L191), the liquidation logic checks ratio <= 8000, making positions with ratio == 8000 eligible for liquidation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The ETH price remains constant or fluctuates minimally, maintaining a `borrowingHealth` of `8000`.
2. No drastic market movements occur to push the position's `ratio` above or below `8000` during a short time frame.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Simultaneous eligibility for withdrawal and liquidation creates unpredictability, reducing user confidence
2. Users might lose funds in positions they perceive as safe, damaging protocol trust.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Align the thresholds by ensuring withdrawal and liquidation conditions are distinct and non-overlapping:
   - Withdrawal Condition: `borrowingHealth >= 8000`
   - Liquidation Condition: `ratio < 8000`
2. Update the NatSpec documentation to reflect the intended behavior accurately.
