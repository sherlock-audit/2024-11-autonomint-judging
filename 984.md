# Expired Signatures Allow Admin to Bypass Deadline Validation

### Summary

The ```verify()``` function in ```Borrowing.sol``` has a critical flaw in its signature validation. The
function checks if the deadline is less than the current block timestamp, which is the opposite
of how a deadline should work. A deadline should be in the future, not the past. This allows
signatures to be valid indefinitely after the deadline has passed.

### Root Cause

In [borrowing.sol#L671](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L761)
```solidity
if (signer == admin && deadline < block.timestamp) {
``` 

This logic checks whether the deadline is less than the current timestamp, thereby allowing expired signatures instead of rejecting them. This flaw removes the protection intended to prevent unauthorized actions after the deadline has passed.

### PoC

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public admin;

    function verify(
        uint256 deadline,
        bytes memory signature
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        // define digest
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encode(keccak256("Permit(uint256 deadline)"), deadline));

        // get the signer
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);

        if (signer == admin && deadline < block.timestamp) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Deploy the contract with an arbitrary admin address.

2. Generate a signature from the admin address with an expired deadline.

3. Call the verify function with the expired signature.

4. Observe that the function incorrectly returns true.

### Mitigation

1. Correct Deadline Validation: Update the condition to ensure only non-expired signatures are allowed:
```solidity
if (signer == admin && deadline >= block.timestamp) { 
```
2. You could introduce a nonce mechanism to prevent signature reuse:
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedSignatures;

function verify(
    uint256 deadline,
    bytes memory signature
) public view returns (bool) {
    require(deadline >= block.timestamp, "Signature expired");

    bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encode(keccak256("Permit(uint256 deadline)"), deadline));

    require(!usedSignatures[digest], "Signature already used");

    address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
    require(signer == admin, "Invalid signer");

    return true;
}
```
