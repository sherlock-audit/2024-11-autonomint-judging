# Arithmetic Underflow Vulnerability in Liquidation Type 1 Mechanism

### Summary

A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the `liquidationType1` process where the `yields` calculation is susceptible to arithmetic underflow. This flaw can prevent administrators from executing necessary liquidations of borrower positions, creating a persistent denial-of-service condition that compromises the protocol's risk management capabilities.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the subtraction operation in the `yields` calculation, which will always revert when the 
current `exchangeRate` will be less than the exchange rate of (borrower's Asset / ETH) at the time of borrower's deposit. 

**NOTE: liquidations happen only when the current asset price falls below the asset price at deposited by 0.8 ratio. | So here we can also say that the Asset/ETH 
current exchange rate must fallen from what it was before at the time of borrow's deposit** 

- Now coming to the flow back ->

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L187) Current 
ongoing `exchangeRate` is calculated inside function `liquidationType1`:

```solidity
(uint128 exchangeRate, /*uint128 ethPrice*/ ) =
borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));
```
[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L265) now 
Yeild calculation happens, where underflow will definitely happen, whenever the `exchangeRate` value will be lesser than what it was at the time of deposit. 

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

We can see how `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH` at the time of deposit was calculated like this [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L655) -> 

We can see it is calculated with "exchangeRate" that was going on that time of deposit, that is later on set as `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`.

```solidity
params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;
```

So real `yeilds` calculations, where this will revert -> 

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

Here value of `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)` is going to be bigger than value of `depositDetail.depositedAmount`.
So when this subtraction happens at that time underflow revert will happen.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The issue manifests when market conditions cause the current exchange rate to drop below the historical rate recorded at deposit time. This scenario is particularly concerning as it typically coincides with situations requiring liquidation intervention.


### Attack Path

Using realistic market values:
- Initial deposit amount: 1e18
- Recorded ETH amount: 1.02e18
- Current exchange rate: 1.01e18

The calculation attempts:
```solidity
int256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```
This operation inevitably results in an underflow REVERT.


### Impact

The vulnerability creates several serious consequences:
1. Prevention of timely liquidations despite deteriorating position health
2. Accumulation of bad debt within the protocol
3. Loss of potential liquidation revenues for CDS participants
4. Undermining of the protocol's risk management mechanisms

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The solution requires careful architectural consideration. A complete redesign of the yields calculation mechanism may be necessary to handle declining exchange rate scenarios properly.
