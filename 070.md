# Borrower could use stablecoins for collateral

### Summary
As specified in the README of the contest and the protocol specifications, collateral should only consist of ETH and ETH-like tokens. However, the current logic allows borrowers to borrow against all available assets, including stablecoins such as USDA and USDT.

### Root Cause
There is no verification to ensure that only ETH and ETH-like tokens are deposited as collateral.

```solidity
    function depositTokens(
        BorrowDepositParams memory depositParam
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(0)) {
        // Assign options for lz contract, here the gas is hardcoded as 400000, we got this through testing by iteration
        bytes memory _options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0);
        // calculting fee
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
@>>         depositParam.assetName,
            _options,
            false
        );
        // Get the exchange rate for a collateral and eth price
@>>     (uint128 exchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = getUSDValue(assetAddress[depositParam.assetName]);

        totalNormalizedAmount = BorrowLib.deposit(
            BorrowLibDeposit_Params(
                LTV,
                APR,
                lastCumulativeRate,
                totalNormalizedAmount,
                exchangeRate,
                ethPrice,
                lastEthprice
            ),
@>>         depositParam,
            Interfaces(treasury, globalVariables, usda, abond, cds, options),
            assetAddress
        );

........
    }
```
Enum:
```solidity
   enum AssetName {
        DUMMY,
        ETH,
        WeETH,
        WrsETH,
        rsETH,
        USDa,
        ABOND,
        TUSDT
    }
```

### Attack Path
A user attempts to borrow USDA against USDT/USDA. In the current codebase, this is allowed because there are no checks in place to prevent it. However, this contradicts the project's documentation and workflow: [Autonomint Docs](https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/working-of-the-protocol).

### Impact
- This could lead to pegging issues for the USDA asset if it can be borrowed against itself, as this is not how the hedging mechanism is intended to work.
- It deviates from the intended protocol workflow.

### Mitigation
Implement a check to limit the types of borrowing assets to only those that are allowed.
