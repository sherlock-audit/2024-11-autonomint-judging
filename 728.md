# User can always renew their position

### Summary

The check for  position renew based on time passed is wrong and will always pass allowing users to renew their position even if the deadline has passed.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib.sol` The timestamp check will always pass since both statements inside the if statement cannot both be correct

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Market price reaches the striker price the user has set after an indefinite amount of time

### Attack Path

1. Create a position
2. After the position has expired and time has passed and the current market price matches the strike price the user renews their position and earns the profit

### Impact

The user is allowed a riskless position as they can just withdraw their position without paying any option fees if they no longer want to wait for the market price to reach the strike price

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the expiry check
