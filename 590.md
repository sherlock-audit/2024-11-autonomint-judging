# The Abond_Token contract lacks the WhenNotPaused Modifier

### Summary

The Abond_Token contract fails to implement the ``whenNotPaused`` modifier on key functions such as ``mint``, ``transfer``, and ``burn``. This renders the pause mechanism ineffective, allowing these functions to be called even when the contract is in a paused state. This flaw compromises the intended control over token operations during emergencies, which can lead to potential misuse or exploits.

### Root Cause

The Abond_Token contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20PausableUpgradeable but does not implement the ``whenNotPaused`` modifier on critical functions expected to be restricted during a paused stateâ€”such as ``mint``, ``transfer``, and ``burn``

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Emergency response measures, like halting operations to investigate issues, become ineffective, exposing the protocol to further harm.

This function is rendered useless
```solidity
    function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Introduce the ``whenNotPaused`` modifier to the necessary functions
