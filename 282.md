# `borrowing.sol::depositTokens`  lacks slippage protection

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L257
In `borrowing.sol::depositTokens`, a user might expect a certain amount of usda tokens, but get less tokens than expected, due to lack of slippage protection in the `borrowing.sol::depositTokens` function. The usda minted to borrowers, on depositing their collateral tokens is calculated in `BorrowLib.sol::tokensToLend`
```solidity
    function tokensToLend(
        uint256 depositedAmount,
        uint128 ethPrice,
        uint8 LTV
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
@>>     uint256 tokens = (depositedAmount * ethPrice * LTV) / (USDA_PRECISION * RATIO_PRECISION);
        return tokens;
    }
```
Two of the parameters in this formular are beyond the control of the borrower. 
1. `ethPrice` : Between the time of the function call, and the time of execution of the function, there can be a change in the current price of eth. This might be unbearable for the user as it will be unexpected and may result in them getting less tokens than expected 
2. `LTV`: There can be a race condition between the admin resetting LTV and a user calling `borrowing.sol::depositTokens`. This can lead to case where the user might not agree with the newly set LTV but is forced to borrow at such LTV, hence getting less usda tokens than expected.
