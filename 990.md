# Unrestricted Access to Downside Protection Updates Creates Permanent DoS Risk in CDS::updateDownsideProtected.

### Summary

A severe vulnerability exists in the `updateDownsideProtected` function where any malicious actor can manipulate the `downsideProtected` state variable by setting it to extreme values like `uint256.max`. This manipulation can result in a permanent denial of service condition, rendering the CDS contract's critical deposit and withdraw operations inoperable.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of access control and input validation in the function [`updateDownsideProtected`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829). It allows anyone to set any value for `downsideProtected` without any checks. (Now once the `downsideProtected` is set to uint256.max, then no one can reset it to 0 from the same function, as it always adds +=)

```solidity
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```
The unprotected nature of this function creates a significant security risk that can be exploited to completely disable core contract functionality.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious actor identifies the unprotected function
2. Executes `updateDownsideProtected` with maximum possible value
3. Contract's deposit and withdrawal mechanisms become permanently blocked
4. No recovery mechanism exists once the value is set


### Impact

The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to:
- Complete paralysis of the CDS contract's core operations
- Permanent lockup of user funds in the contract
- Loss of protocol functionality and user trust
- Inability to process new deposits or handle withdrawals


### PoC

A malicious user calls the function `updateDownsideProtected` function and sets downsideProtected to `uint256.max`.

```solidity
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```

Now, the next time any user who wants to [CDS::deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L186) at that time this line will be executed [_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L234) and will cause revert each and ever time it will be executed.

```solidity
    function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {

// @audit REVERT!    
          
@->         totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }
```

The reason why it will revert is because in this function `totalCdsDepositedAmount` represents the amount of total CDS deposit which is obviously going to be a realistic number that is going to be less than `downsideProtected` (which is already set to `uint256.max` by a malicious user). 

So this is how the DoS will happen in `CDS::deposit`, and the same flow of DoS will also happen in `CDS::withdraw` over [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L324)    


### Mitigation

Implement strict access controls on the `updateDownsideProtected` function to restrict its usage to authorized administrators only. Additionally, consider adding value validation checks to prevent unreasonable updates.
