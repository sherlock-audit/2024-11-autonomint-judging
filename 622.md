# Unrefunded Excess ETH in Contract

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the contractâ€™s fee handling mechanism, where excess native tokens sent by users for fee payments accumulate within the contract and are not refunded; Leading to potential loss of user funds.

### Root Cause

In the contract, when users renew options, they are required to send a fee in native tokens to cover the transaction costs. However, this fee amount is dynamic and subject to change. The contract fails to account for any excess fee amount sent by the user, allowing the unspent amount to accumulate within the contract. This issue arises because the function only uses the native fee (``fee.nativeFee``) and ignores any additional funds sent by the user beyond the required fee.

The specific issue occurs within the ``borrowLib::deposit`` function, where there is no check to ensure that the amount being deposited (``params.depositingAmount``) matches the actual ``msg.value`` sent by the user. This oversight results in untracked excess funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

When a user deposits a native token, the contract does not verify if the deposit amount (``params.depositingAmount``) matches the ``msg.value`` sent. This means that if a user sends more native tokens than required for the fee, the excess amount is not refunded and continues to accumulate in the contract. Malicious users could potentially exploit this by sending more native tokens than necessary and then withdrawing or using the excess funds in subsequent transactions.

### Impact

The vulnerability could result in the loss of user funds through the accumulation of excess native tokens that are not refunded

```solidity
function deposit(
    IBorrowing.BorrowLibDeposit_Params memory libParams,
    IBorrowing.BorrowDepositParams memory params,
    IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces,
    mapping(IBorrowing.AssetName => address assetAddress) storage assetAddress
) public returns (uint256) {
    uint256 depositingAmount = params.depositingAmount;
    // If depositing native tokens, check that msg.value matches depositingAmount
    // Missing confirmation here allows an attacker to exploit excess tokens
    ITreasury.DepositResult memory depositResult = interfaces.treasury.deposit{
        value: params.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? params.depositingAmount : 0
    }(msg.sender, libParams.ethPrice, uint64(block.timestamp), params.assetName, params.depositingAmount);
}
```
Since there is no validation between ``params.depositingAmount`` and ``msg.value``, any excess been sent are not been refunded.

### Mitigation

- Ensure that `msg.value` matches `params.depositingAmount` in all relevant functions.
- Refund any excess native tokens immediately after processing the transaction fee to prevent accumulation in the contract.
- Add proper validation to confirm that the correct amount of native tokens is being sent for the transaction fee.
