# CDS liquidators will receive increased rewards at the expense of the treasury

### Summary

interest on borrowed amount and fees spend on external protocol not substracted from rewards

### Root Cause

According [to docs](https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/liquidation-management) and code, there should be substraction from amount that will be distributed amount cds holders: `Br + f`:
> Since 0.5 ETH is in external protocol so getting back that amount will cost some fees. Suppose that fees is f. Also, we have the interest on borrowed amount i.e br which was not returned
> So, Total amount returned to dCDS Pool = 1 ETH + 400 USDa - Br -f

But its not implemented in code
```solidity
        liquidationInfo = CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo(
            liquidationAmountNeeded,
            cdsProfits,
->            depositDetail.depositedAmount,
            omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount,
            depositDetail.assetName,
            ((depositDetail.depositedAmount * exchangeRate) / 1 ether)
        );
        ...
                    //Update totalInterest
            omniChainData.totalInterest += borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount;
->         interfaces.treasury.updateTotalInterest(borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount);// total interest will be taken by cds holders

In recommendation I substracted interest and fee from it

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

always happening

### Impact

CDS liquidators will receive increased rewards at the expense of the treasury

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
`/ exchangeRate * 1 ether` is to convert to liqudated asset
feeFromExternalProtocol should be a constant value set by protocol
```diff
        liquidationInfo = CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo(
            liquidationAmountNeeded,
            cdsProfits,
-            depositDetail.depositedAmount,
+            depositDetail.depositedAmount- uint256((borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + feeFromExternalProtocol) / exchangeRate * 1 ether,
            omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount,
            depositDetail.assetName,
            ((depositDetail.depositedAmount * exchangeRate) / 1 ether)
        );

```
