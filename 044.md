# Users cannot withdraw their collateral in the ``Treasury.sol``

## Summary
``Treasury::withdraw`` function contains a logic error in its require condition for verifying withdrawal eligibility. The condition incorrectly checks if the withdrawed flag is `true`, which blocks legitimate withdrawals for new deposits.
## Vulnerability Details
Since the default value of withdrawed is false, any new deposit will initially have `withdrawed = false`.
```javascript
require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
```
The require statement above essentially requires the value to be `true` to proceed. If `withdrawed` is `false` (default), the statement fails, and the function reverts with the message "Already withdrawn" and blocking legitimate withdrawals.

But the expected behaviour is that withdrawals should only be allowed if the `withdrawed` flag is `false`, indicating that the deposit has not yet been withdrawn.
## Impact
Users cannot withdraw their collateral from new deposits because the require condition fails for all deposits where `withdrawed = false` (default).

## Recommendation 

- Change the logic in the require statement to ensure withdrawals are allowed only when `withdrawed` is `false`:

```javascript
require(!depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
```
This ensures withdrawals are possible for new deposits.

- Set the withdrawed flag to true after a successful withdrawal:
```javascript
depositDetails.withdrawed = true;
```
