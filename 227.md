# CDS::ethPrice has different values in deposit and withdraw, which will incorrectly set the native ETH price

### Summary

In the `CDS::deposit` function the ethPrice is updated correctly using the oracle. However, the `CDS::withdraw` function uses AssetName.WeETH to set the ethPrice variable which will return a higher value than the actual native ETH price. This will cause a discrepancy between the real native ETH price and the ETH price used in the protocol.

### Root Cause

[CDS::withdraw, set ethPrice using AssetName.WeETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L302)

The `CDS::withdraw` function sets ethPrice using the AssetName.WeETH in lines 301-305
```javascript
        // Get the exchange rate and eth price for all collaterals
@>      (uint128 weETH_ExchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH));
        (uint128 rsETH_ExchangeRate, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH));

        if (ethPrice == 0) revert CDS_ETH_PriceFeed_Failed();
```

ETH price is updated with updateLastEthPrice(ethPrice) in line 406 of `CDS.sol`

### Internal pre-conditions

- User deposit in CDS
- User withdraw from CDS

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User deposits USDT in CDS
2. User withdraws from CDS
3. ETH price is updated in CDS::withdraw function
4. ETH price is now incorrect and set to WeETH price instead of native ETH price
5. May lead to premature liquidations since WeETH price is higher than ETH

### Impact

The ETH price is incorrect and can lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol such as premature liquidations.

### PoC

Insert the PoC in `borrowing.t.sol`
- Run the test with `forge test --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --mt testDepositAndWithdrawFromCds -vvvv`
- Look at ETH price in traces of test to compare

```javascript
    function testDepositAndWithdrawFromCds() public { // ethPrices can be seen in the traces of the deposit and withdraw emitted events using -vvvv
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        contractsA.usdt.mint(address(USER),5000000000);
        uint256 usdtBalance = contractsA.usdt.balanceOf(address(USER));
        contractsA.usdt.approve(address(contractsA.cds),usdtBalance);
        // ethPrice at deposit is 1e5
        contractsA.cds.deposit{value:globalFee.nativeFee}(uint128(usdtBalance),0,true,uint128(usdtBalance), ETH_PRICE);


        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        // ethPrice at withdraw is 1e6
        contractsA.cds.withdraw{value: globalFee3.nativeFee}(1,1000e3,0,1,"0x");
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

- Instead of using AssetName.WeETH to set the ethPrice variable, use AssetName.ETH in withdraw function or getLatestData() to prevent this vulnerability

```diff
    function withdraw(
        uint64 index,
        uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(5)) {
        if (!_verify(FunctionName.CDS_WITHDRAW, excessProfitCumulativeValue, nonce, "0x", signature)) revert CDS_NotAnAdminTwo();
        // Check whether the entered index is present or not
        if (cdsDetails[msg.sender].index < index) revert CDS_InvalidIndex();

        CdsAccountDetails memory cdsDepositDetails = cdsDetails[msg.sender].cdsAccountDetails[index];
        if (cdsDepositDetails.withdrawed) revert CDS_AlreadyWithdrew();

        // Check whether the withdraw time limit is reached or not
        if (cdsDepositDetails.depositedTime + withdrawTimeLimit > uint64(block.timestamp)) revert CDS_WithdrawTimeNotYetReached();

        cdsDepositDetails.withdrawed = true;

        if (cdsDetails[msg.sender].index == 1 && index == 1) {
            --cdsCount;
        }

        // Get the exchange rate and eth price for all collaterals
-       (uint128 weETH_ExchangeRate, uint128 ethPrice) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH));
+       (uint128 weETH_ExchangeRate, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH));
+       (, uint128 ethPrice) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH));
        (uint128 rsETH_ExchangeRate, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH));
```
