# Unused `cdsDepositDetails.lockingPeriod` Variable

### Summary

The `cdsDepositDetails.lockingPeriod` variable is set during the CDS deposit process by the depositor to specify a period for which their deposit is locked. However, there is no logic implemented to utilize this variable in the protocol. This omission renders the variable redundant and can lead to confusion for developers and users, as well as a missed opportunity to enforce locking mechanisms.

### Root Cause

The `cdsDepositDetails.lockingPeriod` variable is stored but remains unused because the logic to enforce or validate deposit locking periods is absent. This indicates either a design oversight or an incomplete implementation of the locking functionality.
