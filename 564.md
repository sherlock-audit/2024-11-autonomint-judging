# Several functions in CDS and Borrowing can be bricked, due to insufficient validation in `multiSign.executeSetterFunction`

### Summary

In multiSign the `executeSetterFunction` can be called by anyone. This is problematic as by calling the function every owner's approval for a function update is reset to false, allowing users to prevent contract variable updates in CDS.sol and Borrowing.sol.

### Root Cause

In multiSign.executeSetterFunction there is no validation preventing users from successfully calling the function. This enables malicious users to call `executeSetterFunction` right before an owner-only setter function has been called, in order to reset the approval, preventing the owner from performing the update.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An admin intends to update the LTV in the borrowing.sol contract.
2. A malicious user frontruns the admin's call to `setLTV`, calling `executeSetterFunction`, as the new LTV will not benefit them.
3. This will reset the owners' approvals, causing the admin's call to `setLTV` to revert.

### Impact

Malicious users can brick the following contracts:
-CDS: setAdmin, setWithdrawTimeLimit, setTreasury, setUSDaLimit, setUSDtLimit
-borrowing: setTreasury, setAdmin, setLTV, setBondRatio, setAPR

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow only the borrowing.sol and CDS.sol contracts to be able to call  `executeSetterFunction`.
