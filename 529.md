# Improper Index Handling in `transferFundsToGlobal` May Cause Logic Errors and Fund Mismanagement

### Summary

The [`transferFundsToGlobal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L772) function processes an array of transfer amounts and attempts to transfer funds based on their indices. However, the handling of indices for `transferAmounts` and asset addresses is flawed, particularly for the case of i == 2.
This function is called [`_lzReceive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L587) with the following order 
```javascript
treasury.transferFundsToGlobal([
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.weETHToSend,
                    oappData.collateralTokenTransferData.rsETHToSend,
                    oappData.oftTransferData.tokensToSend
                ]
            );
```

### Root Cause

When `i==2` we're working with `WrsETH` however the function approves  `transferAmounts[1]` (amount for weETHToSend ) instead of `transferAmounts[2]` (amount for rsETHToSend) in 
```javascript
if (i == 2) {
                        if (!IWrsETH(assetAddress).approve(assetAddress, transferAmounts[1])) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed(); // using 1 instead of i
                        IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
                        assetAddress = borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH);
                    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Since the approval is made for another amount, if  `transferAmounts[1] <  transferAmounts[2]`, the line 
```javascript
IWrsETH(assetAddress).withdraw(borrow.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.rsETH), transferAmounts[2]);
```
will revert as the approval doesn't cover the whole amount, this means the `_lzReceive`, this function is used everywhere which can cause the break of the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the index i inside the loop for all `transferAmounts[i]`
