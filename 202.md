# ionic silent error on mint

### Summary

`mint` doesn't revert on failure it returns an error code

### Root Cause

Whenever user redeems abond tokens, they should be always be able to do it from docs:
 >the current price or redemption value of ABOND is set at $4.

but when for whatever reason compound/ionic fails silently:

1. paused
2.  compound has insufficient cash
3.  market's block number equals current block number

Compound returns for `mint`- 0 on success, otherwise an [Error code](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#mint)
So, whenever user deposits and mint silent fails this means that weth will be in protocol and just approved to ionic. But ionic's **tokens will be assigned to that borrower** via current exchange and his deposits in the code. Next, when user will redeem their abond tokens there will be call to `redeemUnderlying` which will actually revert due to the fact that automint do not have those tokens.

Implementaion from compound:
`assert(cToken.mint(100) == 0);            // mint the cTokens and assert there is no error`
`require(cToken.redeemUnderlying(50) == 0, "something went wrong");`
```solidity
    function depositToIonicByUser(uint256 depositAmount) internal nonReentrant {
        uint256 currentExchangeRate = ionic.exchangeRateCurrent();
        // calculate the current cumulative rate
        _calculateCumulativeRate(currentExchangeRate, Protocol.Ionic);

        // Changing ETH into WETH
        WETH.deposit{value: depositAmount}();

        // Approve WETH to Ionic
        bool approved = WETH.approve(address(ionic), depositAmount);

        if (!approved) revert Treasury_ApproveFailed();

        // Call the mint function in Ionic to deposit eth.
->        ionic.mint(depositAmount);

        uint256 creditedAmount = ionic.balanceOf(address(this));

        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].totalCreditedTokens = creditedAmount;
        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].exchangeRate = currentExchangeRate;
    }

    function withdrawFromIonicByUser(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) internal nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentExchangeRate = ionic.exchangeRateCurrent();
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = _calculateCumulativeRate(currentExchangeRate, Protocol.Ionic);

        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
        uint128 depositedAmount = (aBondAmount * userState.ethBacked) / PRECISION;
        uint256 normalizedAmount = (depositedAmount * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / userState.cumulativeRate;

        //withdraw amount
        uint256 amount = (currentCumulativeRate * normalizedAmount) / CUMULATIVE_PRECISION;
        // withdraw from ionic
->        ionic.redeemUnderlying(amount);

        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].totalCreditedTokens = ionic.balanceOf(address(this));
        protocolDeposit[Protocol.Ionic].exchangeRate = currentExchangeRate;
        // convert weth to eth
        WETH.withdraw(amount);
        return amount;
    }

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Some users will not be able to redeem their abond tokens due to the fact system will think there are more ionic tokens than there are

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement how compound suggest
