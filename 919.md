# Borrower deposit, withdraw, deposit will reinit `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue`, getting profit stuck for cds depositors

### Summary

[BorrowLib::calculateRatio()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L156) sets `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue` to `previousData.totalCDSPool + netPLCdsPool`, disregarding any past value of `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue`, when the `noOfDeposits` is null.
`noOfDeposits` is `omniChainData.totalNoOfDepositIndices`, which is increased and decrease on borrower deposit and withdraw, respectively. Hence, it's possible to make it null again while still having cds depositors and positive long contributions to `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue`.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib:199`, `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue` is overwritten.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Consider a cds depositor of 1000 USDa and a ETH price of 1000 USD / ETH.
2. Borrower deposits 1 ETH and borrows 800 USDa (consider no option fees). Strike price is 1050 USD / ETH.
3. Price goes up to 1050 USD / ETH.
4. Consider that no interest on the debt accrued and the borrower withdraws. `omniChainData.cdsPoolValue` will increase to `1000 + 1 * (1050 - 1000) = 1050`. The cumulative value in cds is [updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L930-L933), adding `1 * (1050 - 1000) / 1000 = 0.05`. 
5. Another borrower comes in, deposits 1 wei of ETH. Note that it will [calculate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L661) the ratio, and `omniChainData.totalNoOfDepositIndices` is 0 now. So, `previousData.cdsPoolValue = currentCDSPoolValue;` is set, and `currentCDSPoolValue = previousData.totalCDSPool + netPLCdsPool = 1000 + 0 = 1000`. `netPLCdsPool == 0` because the price is 1050 now and has not changed.
6. Cds depositor withdraws (ignore 1 wei borrow, it's irrelevant), with a profit of `1000 * 0.05 = 50` USD, but `previousData.cdsPoolValue` is 1000 USD, as the cds depositor tries to withdraw 1050 USD, it [underflows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L395).

### Impact

Cds depositor can not withdraw 50 USDa profit (and whole deposit, until someone else deposits cds and this user steals cds from the next depositor).

### PoC

See above explanation.

### Mitigation

Consider track if there is pending net cds pool.
