# Denial of Service (DoS) in CDS Contract Due to Unrestricted `updateDownsideProtected` Function

### Summary  
The `updateDownsideProtected` function enables any user to set an arbitrarily high value (e.g., `uint256.max`) for the `downsideProtected` variable, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for both the deposit and withdrawal functionalities of the CDS contract.  

### Root Cause  
The root issue lies in the absence of access control and input validation within the [`updateDownsideProtected`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829)function. This function allows any user to increase the `downsideProtected` value without restrictions. Setting the value to `uint256.max` causes subsequent calculations in deposit and withdrawal operations to fail, making the contract's core functionalities unusable.  

```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```  

Once `downsideProtected` reaches `uint256.max`, it becomes impossible to reset the value to zero using the same function since it only increments the variable.  


### internal Pre-Conditions
- The contract does not impose access restrictions on the `updateDownsideProtected` function.  
- The contract assumes `downsideProtected` is always within a realistic range.  

### External Pre-Conditions: 
- An attacker has access to call `updateDownsideProtected`.  
- The attacker can set `downsideProtected` to an excessively high value.  

### Attack Path
1. A malicious actor calls the `updateDownsideProtected` function and sets `downsideProtected` to the maximum possible value (`uint256.max`).  
2. Future calls to the `deposit` or `withdraw` functions invoke `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount`, which attempts to subtract `downsideProtected` from `totalCdsDepositedAmount`.  
3. Since `totalCdsDepositedAmount` cannot realistically exceed `downsideProtected`, the subtraction causes a revert, effectively locking the contract.  

### Impact  
- An attacker can render the CDS contract's primary functions completely inoperable.  
- Deposits and withdrawals in the CDS contract become inaccessible, causing the protocol to lose funds as users can no longer supply USDa or USDT tokens via `CDS::deposit`. Additionally, users attempting to withdraw through `CDS::withdraw` will be unable to retrieve their assets, leaving them indefinitely locked in the contract. 

### Proof of Concept  
A malicious user calls `updateDownsideProtected` with a large value to exploit the vulnerability:  

```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
    downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
}
```  

After setting `downsideProtected` to `uint256.max`, any attempt to call the [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L186) or [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L324)
functions will fail due to the following logic in `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount`:  

```solidity
function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
    if (downsideProtected > 0) {
        totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected; // Reverts here
        totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
        downsideProtected = 0;
    }
}
```  

Since `totalCdsDepositedAmount` cannot realistically exceed `uint256.max`, the subtraction causes the transaction to revert.  

### Mitigation  
- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `updateDownsideProtected` function.
