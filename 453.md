# Unauthorized Updates to `downsideProtected` Causing Reverts and Incorrect Calculations

### Summary

The current implementation allows anyone to call the CDS `updateDownsideProtected` function, which enables unauthorized modifications to the `downsideProtected` variable. This ability introduces several issues, including the potential for downsideProtected to exceed the values of `totalCdsDepositedAmount` or `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, leading to reverts in critical functions including the CDS `deposit` and `withdraw` functions. Additionally, it allows indirect manipulation of `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, causing incorrect calculations in functions like `getOptionsFeesProportions`.

### Root Cause

1. Unrestricted Function Access: The function `updateDownsideProtected` is public and can be called by any external address, including unauthorized users. This allows arbitrary changes to the downsideProtected variable.

2. Logic Dependent on downsideProtected: The `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` function adjusts the `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` based on the value of `downsideProtected`.

If downsideProtected exceeds these totals, it causes underflow errors and reverts in transactions that calls `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount`.

3. Indirect Manipulation of Critical Variables: Because downsideProtected can be updated without proper validation, it can be set to values that are inconsistent with the internal state, leading to inaccurate values for `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, which are used in key calculations.

### Attack Path

1. Unauthorized Update: A user calls the `updateDownsideProtected` function with a value greater than `totalCdsDepositedAmount` or `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`, causing the system to enter an inconsistent state.

2. Reverts in Critical Functions: The next time Cds `deposit` or `withdraw` is called, it calls `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount`, the subtraction of `downsideProtected` from `totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` causes a revert dues to arithmetic underflow error.

3. Incorrect Calculation: Functions such as `getOptionsFeesProportions` use the affected variables (`totalCdsDepositedAmount` and `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees`) for calculations, which will now return incorrect results because of the manipulated state.

### Impact

1. DOS of the deposit and withdraw function as revertion will occur due to arithmetic overflow when downSideProtected is set to values above the `totalCdsDepositedAmount` or `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` variable

2. Miscalculation in the `getOptionsFeesProportions` function as it make use of the affected varible to valculate fees to get from other chains
