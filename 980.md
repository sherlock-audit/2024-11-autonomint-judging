# Incorrect Update of `lastEventTime` in `Borrowings.withDraw()` Function

### Summary

In the `_withdraw()` function of the `Borrowing` contract, `lastEventTime` is updated before calling `calculateCumulativeRate()`. This sequence leads to the skipping of the actual cumulative rate calculation for the period between the previous `lastEventTime` and the current timestamp. Consequently, the interest calculations are inaccurate, affecting the protocol's borrowers debt calculations.

### Root Cause

In the `_withdraw()` function, `lastEventTime` is updated before invoking `calculateCumulativeRate()`. 

```solidity
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
        calculateCumulativeRate();
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L701C1-L704C35

This results in the time interval used for calculating the cumulative rate being effectively reset to zero, bypassing the interest that should have accrued during that period.

Please see the below code which is calculating the cumulative rate based on the time interval

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
@>      uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L530C1-L539C11

```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate(
        uint128 noOfBorrowers,
        uint256 ratePerSec,
        uint128 lastEventTime,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate;

        // If there is no borrowers in the protocol
        if (noOfBorrowers == 0) {
            // current cumulative rate is same as ratePeSec
            currentCumulativeRate = ratePerSec;
        } else {
            // Find time interval between last event and now
@>          uint256 timeInterval = uint128(block.timestamp) - lastEventTime;
            //calculate cumulative rate
            currentCumulativeRate = lastCumulativeRate * _rpow(ratePerSec, timeInterval, RATE_PRECISION);
            currentCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate / RATE_PRECISION;
        }
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Allow a significant time gap since the last transaction to accumulate interest.
2. Execute a withdrawal transaction.
3. Observe that the interest calculation does not account for the accrued interest since the last event due to the premature update of `lastEventTime`.

### Impact

The cumulative rate calculation fails to account for the interest accrued over the actual time interval, resulting in incorrect interest calculations. Since the cumulative rate is used to determine the borrower's debt, this issue causes borrowers to pay less interest than they are entitled to, potentially leading to financial discrepancies within the protocol.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that `calculateCumulativeRate()` is called before updating `lastEventTime` in the `_withdraw()` function.
