# function withdrawUser can revert due to underflow when params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount is subtracted from returnAmountWithGains

### Summary

function withdrawUser can revert due to underflow when params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount is subtracted from returnAmountWithGains. The reason behind this is params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount may become bigger than returnAmountWithGains. If cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount is full cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount and eth price drops(so omniChainData.cumulativeValue will decrease and omniChainData.cumulativeValue will be less  than  cdsDepositDetails.depositValue), as a result  user returnAmount will be less than cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount. If the returnAmount is too much less , then returnAmountWithGains may become less than cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount which will create underflow.


### Root Cause

if cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount is full cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount and eth price drops(so omniChainData.cumulativeValue will decrease and omniChainData.cumulativeValue will be less  than  cdsDepositDetails.depositValue)

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, the user’s  cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount(during deposit time) = 100, cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount = 100( full deposit amount is for liquidation) ,   cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount = 100 , currently(during withdrawal time) omniChainData.cumulativeValue is less  than  cdsDepositDetails.depositValue( both cumulativeValueSign is positive).

2. now the user calls the  function withdraw(cds) where cdsAmountToReturn is called and currentValue = 90(100-90 =  assume 10 amount value is decreased as currently omniChainData.cumulativeValue is less  than  cdsDepositDetails.depositValue ), so cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = currentValue = 90; returnAmount(params.returnAmount) = cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount + optionFees =90+5(assume option fee is 5) = 95.

3. see   function withdrawUser(cdslib.sol) which is called in the  function withdraw(cds.sol), here assume that here all params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount is filled by liquidation index, so currently params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount = 0. returnAmountWithGains = params.returnAmount + params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount = 95+0 = 95, after that cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount is subtracted from returnAmountWithGains i.e returnAmountWithGains -= params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount i.e 95-100, this will create and the whole transaction will revert.
