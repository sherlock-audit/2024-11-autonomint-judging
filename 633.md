# Gas fee may not be refunded, or it may prevent users from withdrawing from CDS

### Summary

When withdrawing from CDS if no option fees and ETH were requested from the other chain the fees intended to be used for the LayerZero message are refunded to the caller:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L410

The issue is that it is possible for funds to have been requested from the other chain and for the fee to have been utilized, but the function to still attempt to refund the assets. This will either allow the caller to receive ETH stored in the contract or more likely will cause the withdrawal to revert due to a lack of funds.

Furthermore, it is possible for the caller to not be refunded the fees even though they should.

### Root Cause

In CDS.withdraw:410 LayerZero gas fees are refunded to the caller if:
```solidity
        if (optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain == 0 && withdrawResult.ethAmount == 0) {
```

This is problematic as it is possible for the if statement to return true, even though `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` has been executed in CDSLib.withdrawUser. This can occur when `collateralToGetFromOtherChain` is not 0 and the other chain provides the required collateral in the form of weETH or rsETH. In that case `withdrawResult.ethAmount` will remain 0, but the LayerZero message would have been sent.

On the other hand, `withdrawResult.ethAmount` may be a non-zero value, even though `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` has not been called and the gas fee has not been utilized. In that case the user will not be refunded their assets even though they should. This can occur as `withdrawResult.ethAmount` is updated even if no collateral is requested from the other chain:

### Attack Path

Here is an example of the first possible issue:
1. User withdraws from CDS and provides 0.1 ETH for LayerZero fees.
2. Collateral must be requested from the other chain, however the other chain provides that collateral in the form of weETH, therefore `withdrawResult.ethAmount` remains 0.
3. 0.1 ETH have been utilized for the LayerZero message, however, the fees are still refunded to the user.
4. The call reverts due to a lack of funds, as the `msg.value` has been completely used.

The second possible issue:
1. User withdraws from CDS and provides 0.1 ETH for LayerZero fees.
2. Collateral is not requested from the other chain, however `withdrawResult.ethAmount` is set to a non-zero value when `getLiquidatedCollateralToGive` is called.
3. 0.1 ETH have not been utilized for the LayerZero message, however, the fees are not refunded to the user as `withdrawResult.ethAmount` is not 0.


### Impact

Users will be unable to withdraw their deposits or will not be refunded their assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refund the gas fees only if `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` has not been called in CDSLib.withdrawUser.
