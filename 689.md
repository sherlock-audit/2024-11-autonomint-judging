# Type TWO liquidations don't update state allowing liquidated borrowers to withdraw

### Summary

Borrowers who have been liquidated should be unable to withdraw their collateral. This is enforced in `BorrowLib::withdraw()` by the following:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L814

However, when the `liquidationType` is `TWO`, `depositDetail.liquidated` is never updated to `true`, allowing borrowers that have been liquidated to still withdraw their collateral.

In fact, there's no liquidation related state that's updated when the `liquidationType` is `TWO`:

```solidity
function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {

        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");


        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000, "You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

        uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);

        weth.deposit{value: amount}();

        bool approved = weth.approve(address(wrapper), amount);

        if (!approved) revert BorrowLiq_ApproveFailed();

        wrapper.mint(amount);
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );

        int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);

        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
            -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
            currentEthPrice * 1e16
        );
    }
```

While this finding highlights that borrowers can still withdraw liquidated collateral, there are many other issues related to the fact that no state is updated during a type TWO liquidation.

### Root Cause

`depositDetail.liquidated` isn't updated to `true` during Type 2 liquidations.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Borrower deposits collateral
2. Admin conducts a type TWO liquidation on borrower 

### External pre-conditions

1. The price of ETH drops 20% or more from the time the borrower deposited their collateral triggering a liquidation.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower deposits collateral and the ETH price is $3000 at the time of deposit.
2. The price of ETH drops 20% to $2400, so the protocol calls Borrowing::liquidate() passing in TWO as the liquidationType to liquidate the borrower.
3. `depositDetail.liquidated` isn't updated to `true` during Type 2 liquidations.
4. The price of ETH increases again pushing the ratio within 20% allowing the borrower to call `Borrowing::withDraw()` and withdraw their collateral.

### Impact

Collateral that should be liquidated to maintain the health of the protocol can be withdrawn by borrowers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `depositDetail.liquidated` to `true` during type TWO liquidation.
