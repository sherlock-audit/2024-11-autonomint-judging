# Missing Multi-Signature Validation in `borrowing.sol::setBorrowLiquidation`

## Summary:
The `setBorrowLiquidation()` function lacks multi-signature validation that is present in other critical setter functions like `setTreasury()`. This inconsistency in security controls could allow a single compromised admin to change the liquidation contract.

## Vulnerability Detials:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L200-L203

The `setBorrowLiquidation()` function lacks the multi-signature validation requirement that exists in other critical setter functions like `setTreasury()`, allowing a single compromised admin to unilaterally change the liquidation contract address to a malicious implementation that could manipulate liquidations and potentially steal funds.

## Impact:
A compromised admin could bypass the protocol's multi-signature security model and set a malicious liquidation contract that could manipulate liquidations, potentially leading to loss of user funds and collateral through unfair or unauthorized liquidations.

## Recommendation
Add multi-signature requirement
