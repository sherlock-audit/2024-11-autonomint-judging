# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `redeemYields` Function

### Summary

A reentrancy vulnerability exists in the `Borrowing:redeemYields` function due to improper handling of external calls during the withdrawal of ETH from an external protocol. The exploit allows malicious users to repeatedly invoke the function and drain all ETH from the external protocol and burn the USDa token based on ratio from Treasury.


### Root Cause


When users redeem ETH yields from the external protocol by returning their ABOND tokens to burn, they call the `redeemYields` function to withdraw ETH from the external protocol and burn the USDa tokens from Treausry contract based on abond usda ratio.

In the [redeemYields](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L989-L993) function implementation, it first checks that the user has enough aBond tokens to burn, and based on that amount, the user receives ETH from the protocol.

```solidity
        // get user abond state
        State memory userState = abond.userStates(user);
        // check user have enough abond
        if (aBondAmount > userState.aBondBalance) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InsufficientBalance();
```

After the calculation of the aBond USDa ratio, this amount of USDa tokens, `usdaToBurn`, is burned from the treasury.

```solidity
        // calculate abond usda ratio
        uint128 usdaToAbondRatio = uint128((treasury.abondUSDaPool() * RATE_PRECISION) / abond.totalSupply());
        uint256 usdaToBurn = (usdaToAbondRatio * aBondAmount) / RATE_PRECISION;

        //...

        //Burn the usda from treasury
        treasury.approveTokens(
            IBorrowing.AssetName.USDa,
            borrow,
            (usdaToBurn + usdaToTransfer)
        );

        IUSDa usda = IUSDa(usdaAddress);
        // burn the usda
        bool burned = usda.contractBurnFrom(address(treasury), usdaToBurn);
        if (!burned) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();
        //...
```

After it call the Treasury contract `withdrawFromExternalProtocol` function.

```solidity
        // withdraw eth from ext protocol
        uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);
```

In the [withdrawFromExternalProtocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L290) function, the internal `withdrawFromIonicByUser` function is first called to calculate the amount based on the user's ABOND states. Then, this amount of ETH is withdrawn from `Ionic` to the Treasury contract, and the `redeemAmount` from that function is returned.


Note: 

This function has a [nonReentrant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L706) modifier. If we think of the `nonReentrant` modifier as preventing re-entry into this function during the same transaction, that is correct. However, letâ€™s examine how this actually works here.

The `nonReentrant` modifier ensures that a function cannot be re-entered within the same transaction. When the function is entered, `_status` is set to `ENTERED`. This prevents the function from being called again in the same transaction. However, after the execution of the function is completed (e.g., `withdrawFromIonicByUser`), the `_nonReentrantAfter` function is called, which resets `_status` to `NOT_ENTERED`.  This allows the function to be called again because once the function is completed, the nonReentrant modifier calls _nonReentrantAfter.


The [withdrawFromIonicByUser](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L703-L725) function handles the withdrawal of ETH from the `Ionic` protocol based on the user's `ABOND` state. It calculates the amount to withdraw using the user's deposited ABOND balance, the current exchange rate, and the cumulative rate. After determining the withdrawal amount, the function interacts with the Ionic protocol to redeem the `underlying` value, converts `WETH to ETH`, and returns the resulting `redeemAmount`. This `redeemAmount` is then sent to the user.

So `nonReentrant` modifier is applied to this function, but it does not prevent reentrancy in this case because the function must execute fully and return a value.

```solidity
    function withdrawFromExternalProtocol(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
        if (user == address(0)) revert Treasury_ZeroAddress();

        // Withdraw from external protocols
@>        uint256 redeemAmount = withdrawFromIonicByUser(user, aBondAmount);
        // Send the ETH to user
@>        (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        // check the transfer is successfull or not
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        return redeemAmount;
    }
```


In this scenario, the Treasury contract [calls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L292) the user's address and sends the `redeemAmount` of ETH to the user. If the user implements custom logic in a `receive` function that gets triggered upon receiving ETH, they could invoke the `redeemYields` function again. This would allow the user to bypass the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L989C1-L993C1), as they still retain ownership of the ABOND tokens, the user could repeatedly burn USDa from the Treasury, withdraw ETH again from the external protocol, and ultimately send it to their own address, effectively exploiting the system to drain funds.


```solidity
        // withdraw eth from ext protocol
        uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

        //Burn the abond from user
        bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount);
        if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

```

### Attack Path

Explained in the Root Cause section in detail.

1. The attacker deposits collateral (e.g., ETH) into the system.
2. Upon withdrawal, the attacker receives 50% of their collateral in ETH, while the remaining amount is given as ABOND tokens.
3. The attacker then calls `Borrowing:redeemYields` to exchange the ABOND tokens for ETH, initiating the withdrawal process.
4. The attacker uses a malicious contract as the receiver of ETH in order to trigger reentrancy by implementing custom logic in the receive function.
5. This causes the `redeemYields` function to be called again, allowing the attacker to bypass the checks and continue burning USDa from the Treasury and withdrawing ETH, draining funds.


### Impact

Allows attackers to completely drain ETH from the protocol and burn USDa from the Treasury.


### PoC

This appears to be a classic and straightforward reentrancy attack. Given its simplicity, creating PoC might not be necessary initially. However, if required during the judging phase, one could be submitted1

### Mitigation


Add the `nonReentrant` modifier to the `redeemYields` function:

```diff
    function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
-    ) public returns (uint256) {
+    ) public nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Call redeemYields function in Borrow Library
        return (
            BorrowLib.redeemYields(
                user,
                aBondAmount,
                address(usda),
                address(abond),
                address(treasury),
                address(this)
            )
        );
    }
```
