# CDS.lib#verify - Signatures can be replayed in `withDraw()` for different users

### Summary

The signature used for `withDraw` verification does not include a nonce and this can lead to signature replay attacks. Due to the lack of a nonce, `withDraw` can be called multiple times with the same signature for different users.

### Root Cause

On [withDraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L281-L310) user needs to be verified by passing a signature. Users pass only `odosAssembledData` and `signature` to the `verify` function. However, there is the nonce field set to 0 which means that the same signature can be reused multiple times. Also, the signature is not tight to one user, so a valid signature can be used by multiple users.
```js
    function verify(
        bytes memory odosExecutionData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external view onlyBorrowingContract returns (bool) {
        return
            _verify(
                FunctionName.BORROW_WITHDRAW,
                0,
                0,
                odosExecutionData,
                signature
            );
    }
```
