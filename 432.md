# Missing Update of usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw in Non-Liquidation Withdrawals

### Summary

The `updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` function, responsible for tracking the amount of USDA deducted from `returnAmountWithGains` during withdrawals, is not invoked in the `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq` function. This results in an inconsistency between the tracked and actual collateral deducted for withdrawals.

### Root Cause

The logic for updating the `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` value is only implemented in the path for withdrawals for user that opted for liquidation. The corresponding update logic was omitted from the implementation of `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq`, despite collateral being deducted in this case as well.

### Impact

Accounting Discrepancies: The total amount tracked by usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw is inaccurate, leading to potential misrepresentation of the treasury's actual collateral position.

Auditing Challenges: The discrepancy complicates audits and reconciliation, as the tracked values do not reflect actual system operations.
