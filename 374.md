# downsideProtected does not work for borrowers

### Summary

`downsideProtected` does not take effect for the borrowers. The borrowers have to pay more debt than expected.

### Root Cause

When borrowers borrow USDa, borrowers need to pay some option fees. Their collateral will be protected. If Ether price drops 10%, borrowers need to repay `borrowed amount + borrow interest - downsideProtected`, and get back all collateral. The cds owners will cover these downsideProtected loss.

When borrowers repay USDa, we check [users' usda balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L833). Borrowers' usda balance should not be less than `borrowerDebt - downsideProtected`. That's correct.

The problem is that we transfer more usda than expected. The total amount that borrowers need to repay is `depositDetail.borrowedAmount - discountedCollateral + borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount + discountedCollateral` = `borrowerDebt`. So the downsideProtected does not work for borrowers. Borrowers have to pay for the downsideProtected part.

```soldiity
            if (interfaces.usda.balanceOf(msg.sender) < borrowerDebt - downsideProtected) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InsufficientBalance();

                uint256 burnValue = depositDetail.borrowedAmount - discountedCollateral;
                bool success = interfaces.usda.burnFromUser(msg.sender, burnValue);
                bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
                    (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral
                );
```
