# Inadequate Liquidation Check for Non-ETH Collateral

### Summary

The  borrowLiquidation contract only checks if the ETH price drops by 20% for liquidation. However, if users deposit different collateral such as rsETH or wETH, the price dynamics against ETH are not considered. This can lead to users being liquidated incorrectly or, worse, not being liquidated when the collateral loses its peg, creating bad debt.



### Root Cause

The liquidation check only considers the ETH price ratio against deposit ETH price and current ETH price, ignoring the price dynamics of other collateral types. Weeth and RsETH are yield-bearing tokens so their price against ETH should increase in the long term. This liquidation check cause incorrect liquidation for this users

It is also possible that other assets could lose their peg against ETH because of exploits or other possible reasons. This positions cant liquidated using current logic which would create a bad debt for the protocol.

```solidity
    function liquidationType1(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        // Check whether the position is already liquidated or not
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");

        // Get the exchange rate and ETH price
        (uint128 exchangeRate /*uint128 ethPrice*/, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));

        // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000,"You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User deposits rsETH or weETH as collateral.
2. The price of rsETH or weETH increases against ETH, but the liquidation check only considers the ETH price.
3. The user is incorrectly liquidated despite the collateral value being sufficient.
4. Alternatively, if rsETH or weETH loses its peg and drops more than ETH, the user cannot be liquidated, leading to bad debt.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect liquidation of users with non-ETH collateral.
Creation of bad debt if non-ETH collateral loses its peg and cannot be liquidated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a more comprehensive liquidation check  to consider other collateral price changes

```solidity
uint128 ratio;
if (params.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
    ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
} else {
    ratio = BorrowLib.calculateCollateralPriceRatio(depositDetail.collateralPriceAtDeposit, collateralPrice);
}
```
