# Loss of User Funds Due to Incorrect LZ Fee Handling in Borrowing and CDS Contracts

### Summary

When user interact with the protocol for Deposit some collateral or withdraw in the borrowing or join to dCDS in these interaction user must give some native token to send data to the lz through the globalVariables for the fees to send lz transaction. These fees are calculated a call to quote function in the globalVariables contract in that contract quote function is Calling layer zero quote function to get the fee for the lz transaction.

```solidity
        MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),               
            depositParam.assetName,  
            _options,
            false
        );
```

after fees are calculated send function in globalVariables calls with data and `fee.nativeFee` native tokens which calls send internal to send lz transaction.

```solidity
        globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
            IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
            depositParam.assetName,
            fee,
            _options,
            msg.sender
        );
```

The problem here is that if a user pays more `msg.value` then `fee.nativeFee` it transfer only `fee.nativeFee` amount of native token, the additional `msg.value` remains and gets stuck in the CDS or Borrowing contract. Conversely, if the user pays less `msg.value` than `fee.nativeFee`, the contract sends the native token of `address(this)`.



Affeceted functions:

- borrowing:depositTokens
- borrowing:renewOptions
- CDS:deposit
- CDS:redeemUSDT


Note: Based on the Sherlock rules, this report is not invalid because these native tokens are not transferred accidentally; they must be transferred for the fees.

> Accidental ETH/native token transfers Merely because a contract allows it, are not valid as medium/high issues.


### Root Cause


The core issue stems from insufficient validation and handling of excess native token amounts `msg.value` sent for lz fees because in these contracts don't have any functionality that withdraw excess ETH/native token and not refund mechanism for the users:

- No validation comparing `msg.value` against `fee.nativeFee`
- No refund mechanism for excess native tokens
- Potential use of contract's native token balance when user `msg.value` set to zero. In this case, the user does not transfer any fee if there are native tokens in the contract that can be sent to the LZ transaction for fees.

### Attack Path

Check the summary; it describes the issue.


### Impact

Loss of user funds and native tokens become permanently locked in the contract.


### PoC

### Mitigation


Implement strict fee validation:

```solidity
    MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(...);

+    require(msg.value == fee.nativeFee, "Incorrect fee amount");

    globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(...);
```

If the user can't calculate how much fee is needed, add a refund mechanism for excess payments.

```solidity

    MessagingFee memory fee = globalVariables.quote(...);

+    require(msg.value >= fee.nativeFee, "Insufficient fee");

    globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(...);
    
    // Refund excess
    if (msg.value > fee.nativeFee) {
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: msg.value - fee.nativeFee}("");
        require(success, "Refund failed");
    }
}
```
