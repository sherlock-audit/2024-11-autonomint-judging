# `withdraw` function will revert if `toAddress` is contract which is not intended

### Summary

In withdraw function, there is a check which will revert the function of `toAddress` of param is a contract.
```solidity
function withDraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
@>      if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress))
            revert Borrow_CantBeContractOrZeroAddress(toAddress);
...
}
```
Any contract as user can deposit and work as a normal user in autonomint but in the `withdraw` function, contract cannot be `toAddress` (toAddress will be the address who will get the collateral back while calling withdraw function) so that any contract cannot able to withdraw collateral on the contract address which is not intended behaviour.

### Root Cause

If `toAddress` is contract in withdraw function, it will revert which should not be.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

If any contract is the user of the protocol and deposit their collateral in the protocol, at the time of withdraw, contract will not able to get their collateral on contract address.

That means it is very impractical for the contract to use the protocol as user because it cannot get their deposited collateral back on contract at the time of withdraw.

### Impact

Contract who is the user of the protocol will not able to withdraw collateral back on contract address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol should allowed contract as `toAddress` in withdraw function.

-if (toAddress == address(0) || isContract(toAddress))
+if (toAddress == address(0)
