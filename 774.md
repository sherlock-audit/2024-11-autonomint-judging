# `CDSLib.withdrawUser()` will underflow if collateral price decreases after liquidation

### Summary

`CDSLib.withdrawUser()` will underflow if collateral price decreases after liquidation. That causes funds of CDS users that have opted into liquidation to be locked until the price increases.

### Root Cause

In [`CDSLib.withdrawUser()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L668), the contract calculates the collateral amount with the current price from the ETH price at the time of the liquidation and subtracts that from the collateral amount that was liquidated. That way it gets the yield that the collateral earned in that time:
```sol
            if (
                params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations >=
                liquidationIndexAtDeposit
            ) {
                // Loop through the liquidations that were done after user enters
                for (uint128 i = (liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1); i <= params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations; i++) {
                    uint128 liquidationAmount = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
                    // If the user available liquidation is non zero
                    if (liquidationAmount > 0) {
                        CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationData = omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo[i];
                        // Calculate the share by taking ratio between
                        // User's available liquidation amount and total available liquidation amount
                        uint128 share = (liquidationAmount * 1e10) / uint128(liquidationData.availableLiquidationAmount);
                        // Update users available liquidation amount
                        params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount -= getUserShare(liquidationData.liquidationAmount, share);
                        // Based on the collateral type calculate the liquidated collateral to give to user
                        if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
                            // increment eth amount
                            params.ethAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
                        } else if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH) {
                            // increment weeth amount and weth amount value
@                            weETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
@                            weETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
                        } else if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH) {
                            // increment rseth amount and rseth amount value
                            rsETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
                            rsETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
                        }
                    }
                }
                uint256 returnAmountWithGains = params.returnAmount + params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
                returnAmountWithGains -= params.cdsDepositDetails.initialLiquidationAmount;
                // Calculate the yields which is accured between liquidation and now
                interfaces.treasury.updateYieldsFromLiquidatedLrts(
@                    weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.weETH_ExchangeRate) + 
                    rsETHAmount - ((rsETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.rsETH_ExchangeRate)
                );
```

`liquidationData` is populated in [`borrowLiquidation.liquidationType1()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L219C1-L226C11)

```sol
        liquidationInfo = CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo(
            liquidationAmountNeeded,
            cdsProfits,
            depositDetail.depositedAmount,
            omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount,
            depositDetail.assetName,
            ((depositDetail.depositedAmount * exchangeRate) / 1 ether)
        );

    struct LiquidationInfo {
        uint128 liquidationAmount; // liqudation amount needed
        uint128 profits; // profits gained in the liquidation
        uint128 collateralAmount; // collateral amount liquidated
        uint256 availableLiquidationAmount; // total available liquidation amount during the liquidation
        IBorrowing.AssetName assetName; // collateral type liquidated
        uint128 collateralAmountInETHValue; // liquidated collateral in eth value
    }
```

where `depositedAmount` is the collateral amount, and `depositedAmount * exchangeRate / 1e18` is the ETH value of the collateral amount at the time of the liquidation.

But, if the price, instead of increasing, decreases, this calculation will underflow causing the function to revert and thus lock up user funds.

A price decrease can happen if the collateral loses its peg, e.g. through a hack. Here's a chart showing how Lido's stETH has previously lost its peg: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether/eth

Now, here's an example calculation showing the underflow:

Given that, at the time of the liquidation:
- weETHAmount = 1e18
- exchangeRate = 1.1e18
=> weETHAmountInETHValue = 1e18 * 1.1e18 / 1e18 = 1.1e18

Now, at the time of the user's withdrawal, the price dropped to 1.09e18:
- `weETHAmount - ((weETHAmountInETHValue * 1 ether) /  params.weETH_ExchangeRate) = 1e18 - 1.1e18 * 1e18 / 1.09e18 = 1e18 - 1.009e18 = -9e15`

### Internal pre-conditions
