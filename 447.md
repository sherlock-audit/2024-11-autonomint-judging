# `MasterPriceOracle` contract does not check price staleness

### Summary

The `MasterPriceOracle` contract does not check the staleness whenever retrieving an assets price.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L83

### Root Cause

No staleness checks

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the price is stale then the incorrect price for Ethereum will be used in the contract's logic.

### PoC

The price of Ethereum is retrieved during deposits and withdrawals. An attacker can deposit at a low Ethereum price, wait for an update, then withdraw when the price of Ethereum is finally updated.

Also, it is important to note the oracle used on Mode  (Redstone oracles) is a push based oracle meaning anyone submit the price update data making the previously described attack method even easier.

### Mitigation

Check the timestamp of the returned price like below:
*Note this is for a chainlink oracle.
```solidity
uint256 maxStaleness = 30 minutes;
(, int256 price_,,uint256 timestamp,) = oracle.latestRoundData();
if((block.timestamp - timestamp) > maxPriceStaleness) revert PriceIsStale();
```

Inside of `MasterPriceOracle` always check the timestamp/staleness of the returned price data.
