# USDT and USDa price parameters allow attacker to drain USDT from Treasury

### Summary

An important peg stability mechanism for USDa is the ability for users to redeem USDa for USDT.

In the event that the price of USDa drops to $0.99, arbitragers are incentivized to call `CDS::redeemYields()`, profiting off the swap.

Since USDa is burned during the redeem, the supply of USDa goes down which increases the price. 

Autonomint allows users to redeem USDa for USDT through the `CDS::redeemUSDT` function:

The problem is that the user can input the price of USDT and USDa allowing an attacker to drain the Treasury of USDT for a negligible amount of USDa.

### Root Cause

The price of USDT and USDa are input parameters an attacker can control the values of in `CDS::redeemYields()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There's a non-zero amount of USDT in the treasury

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

NOTE: A separate issue in the `CDS::redeemUSDT` is the way that USDT is calculated (see my issue titled: "Incorrect calculation of usdtAmount causes losses in CDS::redeemUSDT"). I assume that this is corrected when describing the attack path below.
```diff
- uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
+ uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdtPrice * usdaAmount) / usdaPrice);
```

1. Attacker calls `CDS::redeemUSDT()` passing in a very high USDa price (or very low USDT price) which results in the attacker receiving a much larger amount of USDT than they should have received.

### Impact

Loss of all USDT from Treasury

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not allow users to input the price of anything as a parameter.
