# When a CDS withdrawal occurs 10% of option fees are deducted for the protocol instead of 10% of the profits

### Summary

When a CDS withdrawal occurs 10% of the profits on the deposited amount should be kept by the treasury and deducted from the amount, received by the withdrawer. The issue is that currently 10% of option fees are taken by the protocol, which is much lower than the intended 10% of profits.

### Root Cause

In CDSLib.withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq and CDSLib.withdrawUser `calculateUserProportionInWithdraw` is called with  `params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` and `params.returnAmount` as parameters. The issue is that the deposited amount also includes the profits, thus the 10% will be taken out of only the option fees.

### Attack Path

1. User withdraws, with profits from an increased cumulative value equal to 100 USD and option fees of 10 USD, therefore, `params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount` will be set to the deposit + 100 USD and `params.returnAmount` will be set to the deposit + 110 USD.
2. Instead of the protocol keeping 10% of the profits = 11 USD, it will only take 10% of option fees = 1 USD.

### Impact

The protocol loses funds, due to the inaccurate calculation.

### Mitigation

The 10% should be taken out of the cumulative value profits + option fees instead of only the option fees.
