# Replay Attack Vulnerability in Signature Verification in multichain systems

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L878-L916

Lack of domain separation in the signature verification process will cause a security vulnerability for users as an attacker will replay valid signatures across different chains (e.g., Optimism and Mode), potentially allowing unauthorized actions such as withdrawals or state modifications.

## Root Cause: 
The choice to use a shared signature verification process across different chains (e.g., Optimism and Mode) is a mistake as it does not differentiate between the chains, allowing valid signatures to be replayed from one chain to another, thereby enabling potential unauthorized

## Vulnerability Details:
Problem: The _verify function checks signatures for actions like withdrawal requests but does not include the chain ID or contract address in the signature's domain separator.
Impact: This enables the possibility of reusing the same signature on multiple chains. If an attacker obtains a valid signature on one chain, they can reuse it on another chain where the same contract exists, resulting in a replay attack.
Cause: Absence of a domain separator that includes the chainId and the contract address, which is crucial for ensuring the signature is bound to a specific chain and contract.

## Impact
Severity: High
Likelihood: High (if deployed on multi-chain systems without domain separation)

## PoC
Proof of Concept (PoC):

Let's assume a scenario where a user signs a transaction (e.g., a withdrawal request) on one chain (e.g., Optimism). The signature is valid for that chain and is processed correctly. Due to the shared signature verification process and lack of chain-specific checks, this same signature can be replayed on a different chain (e.g., Mode), potentially allowing the user to withdraw assets without permission on Mode.

### Steps:
A user initiates a withdrawal on the Optimism chain and signs the transaction, which includes their address, nonce, and other relevant data (e.g., excessProfitCumulativeValue and nonce).

The smart contract on Optimism verifies the signature and executes the withdrawal.

The user then tries to replay the same signature on the Mode chain by submitting the same transaction with the same signed data.

Since the contract does not differentiate between chains (lacking chain-specific checks), the signature is accepted by the Mode contract as valid and the transaction is processed.

This results in the unauthorized withdrawal of assets on Mode.

### Key Indicators:

The same signed data is used for both chains (Optimism and Mode).

No chain-specific identification or differentiation is implemented in the signature verification process.

Impact: This allows malicious actors or even legitimate users (by mistake) to replay their signed transactions on different chains, leading to unauthorized transactions such as withdrawals or fund transfers.

## Recommendations:

Chain-specific nonce or signature checks: Implement checks to ensure that the signature is valid only for the respective chain by including a chain identifier in the signed data or utilizing different nonces per chain.

Replay Protection: Use replay protection mechanisms to prevent a signature used on one chain from being valid on another chain. This could be achieved by embedding the chain ID in the signature or using separate signature schemes for each chain.

Signature Expiry: Consider adding an expiration timestamp to signatures, limiting the window of validity and reducing the chance of replay attacks.
