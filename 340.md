# lastEventTime is not updated in the  function liquidate, so  CumulativeRate will be bigger than expected.

### Summary

in the function depositTokens/function withDraw(borrowing.sol), CumulativeRate is calculated and updated, also lastEventTime is updated.  in the liquidate function, CumulativeRate is calculated and updated, but lastEventTime is not updated. As a result, CumulativeRate will be bigger than expected and users have to pay more interest than expected.


### Root Cause

 lastEventTime is not updated in the  function liquidate.

### Attack Path

1. Letâ€™s assume, lastEventTime(Borrowing contract) = 12pm,24 december,2024. Current timestamp = 12pm,25 December,2024 and  lastCumulativeRate(interest rate) = 0.3(this is just for example).

2. liquidate function( function liquidationType1) is called(Current timestamp = 12pm,25 December,2024) where  calculateCumulativeRate function is called where timeinterval = 25 december-24 december = 1 day and now lastCumulativeRate is updated/increased to 0.4(this is just for example).

3. see the liquidate function( function liquidationType1) where lastEventTime is not updated to 12pm,25 December,2024 , so lastEventTime(Borrowing contract) is still  12pm,24 December,2024. But lastCumulativeRate is increased from 0.3 to 0.4.

4. after that, function depositTokens(borrowing.sol)/function deposit(borrowingLib.sol) is called(current timestamp is 1pm,25 december,2024) where calculateCumulativeRate function is called where timeinterval = 25 december-24 december = 1 day+1 hour and now lastCumulativeRate is updated/increased to 0.4(this is just for example).now lastCumulativeRate is updated/increased to 0.51(this is just for example). This time  lastEventTime is updated to 1pm,25 December,2024.

5. now CumulativeRate is bigger than expected because lastEventTime is not updated in the liquidate function(where CumulativeRate has increased from 12pm,24 December,2024 to 12pm,25 December,2024 time interval ) and CumulativeRate is again calculated for that time interval (12pm,24 December,2024 to 1pm,25 December,2024 ). CumulativeRate is increased from 0.4 to 0.51(which is double accounting for this time interval).

### Impact

CumulativeRate will be bigger than expected and users have to pay more interest than expected.


### PoC

### Mitigation

update  lastEventTime in the  function liquidate.
