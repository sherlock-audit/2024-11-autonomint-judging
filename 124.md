# Fee mismatch between `quote` and `send` operations causes transaction reverts

### Summary

In the `depositTokens` function of the `Borrowing` contract and in related functions of the `GlobalVariables` contract, the `quote` function calculates the messaging fee based on the current state of `omniChainData`. However, subsequent operations may modify the state of `omniChainData` before the `send` function is executed, potentially causing a mismatch between the quoted fee and the required fee for the `send` operation. And also gas price can be changed because of time for process other operations after `quote` and this causes mismatch. This mismatch can result in transaction reverts.

### Root Cause

- The fee is quoted (`quote`) before any operations are performed that depend on `omniChainData`.
- The state of `omniChainData` may change due to updates performed in between the `quote` and `send` operations.
- This results in the fee calculated using outdated data, causing the `send` operation to revert.
