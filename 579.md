# Exploitable Vulnerability in redeemUSDT Function Allows Protocol Draining

### Summary

The ability of users to input the relative prices of ``USDA`` and ``USDT`` in the ``redeemUSDT`` function can be exploited to drain the protocol of all its available ``USDT`` funds.

### Root Cause

In the ``CDS.sol`` contract, the ``redeemUSDT`` function allows the caller to freely input the ``usdaPrice`` and ``usdtPrice``. This lack of validation enables malicious manipulation, allowing attackers to withdraw an excessive amount of ``USDT``.

The redeemUSDT function performs the following operations:

1. Verifies that usdaAmount > 0.
2. Checks that the caller has sufficient USDA balance.
3. Burns the specified usdaAmount from the caller.
4. Calculates the amount of USDT to be transferred:
uint128 usdtAmount = $$((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice)$$;
5. Transfers the calculated usdtAmount from the treasury to the caller.
The problem lies in the free input of ``usdaPrice`` and ``usdtPrice``. An attacker can manipulate these values to withdraw disproportionate amounts of ``USDT``.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Assume a malicious actor; Thanos observes that 50,000 USDT is deposited in the treasury. They can:

1. Deposit 1 USDT and receive 1 USDA in return via the deposit function.
2. Call redeemUSDT(1, 50000, 1).
This results in:
$$usdtAmount = (usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice$$
$$usdtAmount = (50000 * 1) / 1 = 50000$$

The attacker effectively redeems 50,000 ``USDT`` for 1 ``USDA`` token.


### Impact

This exploit leads to a complete loss of all USDT in the treasury, causing financial damage to users and stakeholders.

        usdaAmount,
        usdaPrice,
        usdtPrice
    );
    // Additional operations
}
```

### Mitigation

Restrict the user's input by Removing  ``usdaPrice`` and ``usdtPrice`` as external inputs. Implement an internal mechanism to fetch and validate these values
