# CDS withdrawals will likely revert due to a lack of tokens

### Summary

When users withdraw from CDS they receive a portion of liquidated collateral in the form of ETH, weETH or wrsETH. If there is insufficient collateral on the chain where the withdrawal occurs a request is made to the other chain, in order to receive the required collateral. The issue is that the protocol expects for the required collateral to be sent by the other chain in the same transaction. This is not possible as the LayerZero message must first be verified by a decentralized verifier network and after that be executed on the destination chain. This process cannot be executed in the same transaction.

As a result, the protocol will attempt to transfer the withdrawer collateral that is yet to be sent by the other chain, causing a revert due to a lack of token funds.

### Root Cause

When requesting collateral from another chain it is impossible for the collateral to be immediately received on the source chain. This wrong assumption is made in the withdraw function of CDS:

### Attack Path

1. User withdraws from CDS and must receive liquidated collateral.
2. There are not enough funds on the chain where the call has been initialized and a request for collateral tokens is made to the other chain.
3. The message is successfully sent to the LayerZero bridge, however, the function assumes that the requested collateral has been received and attempts to transfer it to the withdrawer, causing the withdraw to revert.

### Impact

Withdraws are highly likely to revert in many scenarios.

### Mitigation

Fix is non-trivial. Perhaps, a two phase withdrawal implementation in the case that collateral is requested from the other chain may be a sufficient mitigation.
