# Inconsistent Withdrawal Logic for ETH Depositors in Borrowing Mechanism

### Summary

The current borrowing deposit and withdrawal process treats ETH depositors differently compared to other token depositors. While non-ETH depositors receive their full collateral (minus `collateralRemainingInWithdraw`), ETH depositors lose 10% of their total deposit due to the `abond` minting mechanism.

### Root Cause

1. **General Token Depositors:**
When users deposit tokens other than ETH, users receive the full equivalent value of their deposit (minus `collateralRemainingInWithdraw` if not 0), with no loss in value.

2. **ETH Depositors:**
Depositing ETH involves minting `abond` tokens as a representation of the collateral.
During withdrawal:

- Only 80% of half the deposited ETH value worth of `abond` tokens is minted. which is the `discountedCollateral` amount.

- Users redeem these `abond` tokens for ETH, but only the minted amount (80% of half) is returned.
- The remaining 20% of half the deposited ETH value is retained in the Ionic protocol.

3. The additional retention of 20% of half the deposited ETH value is specific to the `abond` mechanism, leaving ETH depositors at a disadvantage.

### Attack Path

1. **ETH Depositor:**

- Deposit: 10 ETH.
- Withdrawal process:
 calculateHalfValue computes 5 ETH as half the deposit.
 Only 80% of 5 ETH (4 ETH) is minted as abond.
 User redeems 4 ETH.
 1 ETH (20% of 5 ETH) is retained by the ionic protocol.

**Net Loss: 1 ETH (10% of the total deposit).**

2. **Non-ETH Depositor:**

- Deposit: Tokens equivalent to 10 ETH.
- Withdrawal process:
User receives 10 ETH equivalent (minus standard collateral deductions).
**Net Loss: 0 ETH (beyond deductions).**

### Impact

**ETH Depositors:** Face an unfair 10% collateral loss during withdrawal.
