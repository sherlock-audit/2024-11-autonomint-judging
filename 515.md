# CDS withdrawals can be blocked for depositors who opted for liquidation

### Summary

When a CDS depositor opts for liquidation, they benefit from the liquidation profit from different liquidation indexes, since their funds were deposited in the CDS

### Root Cause



```solidity

File: CDSLib.sol
609:     function withdrawUser(
610:         CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
611:         CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
612:         uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
613:         uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees,
614:         mapping(uint128 liquidationIndex => CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo)
615:             storage omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo
616:     ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
617:         if (!params.cdsDepositDetails.optedLiquidation) {
618:             return withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(
619:                     params,
620:                     interfaces,
621:                     totalCdsDepositedAmount,
622:                     totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
623:                 );
624:  @>     } else {
625:             uint128 weETHAmount;
626:             uint128 rsETHAmount;
627:             uint128 weETHAmountInETHValue;
628:             uint128 rsETHAmountInETHValue;
629:             uint128 collateralToGetFromOtherChain;
630:             uint128 totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH;
631: 
632:             uint128 liquidationIndexAtDeposit = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationindex; // index at deposit
633:             // If the number of liquidations is greater than or equal to liquidationIndexAtDeposit
634:             if (
635:                 params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations >=
636:                 liquidationIndexAtDeposit
637:             ) { 
638:                 // Loop through the liquidations that were done after user enters
639:    @>           for (uint128 i = (liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1); i <= params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations; i++) {
640:                     uint128 liquidationAmount = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;


File: borrowLiquidation.sol
198:         // Increment global number of liquidations
199: @>      ++omniChainData.noOfLiquidations;

```

The problem is that the `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` can become so large thus causing the withdrawal call to run out of gas on L639

### Internal pre-conditions

- multiple liquidations have happened globally (on all chains) since the user deposited increasing the `omniChainData.noOfLiquidations` without bounds
- user calls withdraw and the `for loop` runs out of gas because the number of liquidations is not capped.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

CDS deposits funds are stuck without a way for them to withdraw.


I am rating a this a high because users funds can be stuck without a way to withdraw them

### PoC

- Alice deposits into the CDS opting for liquidation
- multiple liquidations have occurred since she made the deposit
- the for loop is encountered and the call runs out of gas because the number of liquidations keep increasing

This more certain to happen for the first depositors especially of they do not withdraw after along time

### Mitigation

A trivial solution is not recommended however, there should be maximum limit to the number of liquidations a user can benefit from from the point of their deposit
