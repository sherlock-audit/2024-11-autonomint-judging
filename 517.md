# CDS.sol#_calculateCumulativeValue - Incorrect calculation of `cumulativeValue` when there is no change in the price

### Summary

The `calculateCumulativeValue` function doesn't handle situations where the ETH price doesn't change. If the `_price` is equal to the `lastEthPrice`, the function calculates a `priceDiff` of zero. This leads to the cumulative value also being set to zero. 


### Root Cause

The `updateCumulativeValueInCDS` function is called upon deposit/withdrawal to update some variables, one of which is `cumulativeValue`. The [_calculateCumulativeValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L25-L52) function calculates `cumulativeValue` depending on whether the price increases or decreases. The problem is that the logic does not handle the case when `_price == lastEthPrice`.

If we look at the else block, since `priceDiff` is calculated from `lastEthPrice - _price`. If `_price` is equal to `lastEthPrice`, the result is priceDiff = 0. The `value` calculations depend on `priceDiff`, and with `priceDiff = 0`, the cumulative value is 0.
```js
        if (_price > lastEthPrice) {
            priceDiff = _price - lastEthPrice;
            gains = true;
        } else {
            priceDiff = lastEthPrice - _price;
            gains = false;
        }
        value = uint128((_amount * vaultBal * priceDiff * 1e6) / (PRECISION * totalCdsDepositedAmount));

```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The cumulative value is used to burn CDS amounts and if the value is zero, the protocol will burn incorrect amounts. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add else case that covers this scenario.
