# Missing usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw update in withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq

### Summary

`usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` is used to record the protocol profit from cds withdrawal. We miss the update `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` in `withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq` function.

### Root Cause

When cds owners withdraw their positions, we will calculate cds owner's profit and split 10% of profit to the protocol team. 
In function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(), we calculate the 90% of cds owner's profit to the cds owners. The left 10% should belong to the protocol team.

The problem is that we miss update `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` via [updateUsdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L493) function. The variable `usdaCollectedFromCdsWithdraw` is used to record the protocol profit from cds users' withdrawal.

```solidity
    function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(
        CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
        params.usdaToTransfer = calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount, params.returnAmount);
}
    function calculateUserProportionInWithdraw(
        uint256 depositedAmount,
        uint256 returnAmount
    ) public pure returns (uint128) {
        uint256 toUser;
        if (returnAmount > depositedAmount) {
            uint256 profit = returnAmount - depositedAmount;
            toUser = returnAmount - (profit * 10) / 100;
        } else {
            toUser = returnAmount;
        }
        return uint128(toUser);
    }
```
