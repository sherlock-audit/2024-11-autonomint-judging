# USDT balance manipulation in Treasury causes DoS of CDS::deposit()

### Summary

Autonomint utilizes a CDS pool to provide 20% downside protection to borrowers. CDS depositors can deposit into the pool using `CDS::deposit` and receive option fees, exposure to ETH price increases, and yield from liquidations (if they opt into this):

In `CDSLib::deposit()`, CDS depositors can only deposit USDT into the pool up until the `usdtLimit` is reached (e.g. 20,000e6):
```solidity
function deposit(
        CDSInterface.DepositUserParams memory params,
        mapping(address => CDSInterface.CdsDetails) storage cdsDetails,
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.DepositResult memory) {
        
        uint256 totalDepositingAmount = params.usdtAmount + params.usdaAmount;
        
...
        // Check whether the usdt limit is reached or not
@>  if (omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow < params.usdtLimit) {
            if (
                (omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow +
                    params.usdtAmount) <= params.usdtLimit
            ) {
                if (params.usdtAmount != totalDepositingAmount) revert CDSInterface.CDS_NeedsUSDTOnly();
            } else {
                revert CDSInterface.CDS_SurplusUSDT();
            }
      }
...
```

An attacker can utilize the `usdtLimit` to cause a one-block DoS indefinitely to CDS depositors calling `CDS::deposit()` by utilizing the following attacks:

If the USDT balance is the Treasury is greater or equal to than the `usdtLimit`:
1. Calculate the balance of USDT in the Treasury
2. Call redeemUSDT() to swap USDa for USDT using the balance of USDT in the Treasury to strategically leave the balance at 19999.999999 USDT (.000001 USDT less than the limit). Now, all `CDS::deposit` calls in the block will fail, unless there's a 0.000001 USDT deposit, which would be highly unlikely since the cost of gas would be more than the deposit amount.

If the USDT balance in the Treasury is less than the `usdtLimit`:
1. Calculate the balance of the USDT in the Treasury
2. Call `CDS::deposit()` and deposit an amount of USDT that brings the Treasury to 19999.999999 USDT.  Now, all `CDS::deposit` calls in the block will fail, unless there's a 0.000001 USDT deposit, which would be highly unlikely since the cost of gas would be more than the deposit.

For this finding to be considered Medium on Sherlock, the DoS must disrupt time-sensitive functions. `CDS.deposit()` is time sensitive because of yield opportunities for CDS depositors in the form of liquidations, ETH price increases, and fee generated from selling options. By blocking deposits, an attacker that is already a CDS depositor can benefit by avoiding sharing any yield generated during the DoS. The likelihood of this attack would be higher during period of high ETH price volatility (since liquidations would be higher and yield from ETH price increases would be higher).

### Root Cause

Since CDS depositors can only deposit USDT into the CDS pool (held in the Treasury) until the `usdtLimit` is reached, this allows for balance manipulation.

### Attack Path

This attack is possible at any point, but for this attack path, let's assume the usdtLimit is 20,000e6 and there is 22,000e6 USDT deposited:
1. Attacker creates an attack smart contract that calculates `uint256 redeemAmount = IERC20(address(usdt)).balanceOf(address(Treasury)) - usdtLimit - 1;`
2. Attacker calls CDS(address(cds)).redeemUSDT() and passes in `redeemAmount`. Let's assume the price of USDa and USDT is equal, otherwise, the attackers contract would have to account for this.
3. Now the USDT Treasury balance is 19,999.999999 USDT. Any other deposits will revert unless there's a 0.000001 USDT deposit, which would be highly unlikely since the cost of gas would be more than the deposit.

### Impact

DoS for CDS pool depositors and loss of yields from potential liquidations, ETH price movement, and option fees. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One possible mitigation is to disallow redeeming of USDT if the redeem is going to bring the balance of the USDT in the Treasury below the `usdtLimit`.
