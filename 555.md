# A malicious borrower can DoS on the liquidation of their position that has below the downside protection

### Summary

When a malicious user deposits collateral from a contract with a custom receive function that reverts tx when called by the `BorrowLiquidation` contract. This behavior prevents the liquidation process for the malicious user's position and creates a scenario where the admin cannot liquidate positions below downside protection.


### Root Cause


The root cause lies in the following section of the `liquidationType1` function:

```solidity
if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
    (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```

If the `msg.value` is attempted to be sent to a user that is a malicious contract that contains a receive function designed to revert when the call from the borrowLiquidation contract, the entire liquidation process for that user fails. This creates a DOS condition, where the admin cannot liquidate the user’s position, even if it is below the downside protection threshold.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. User depoist collateral from a contract address that have custome receive function.
2. The user's position must be eligible for liquidation due to a low ratio.
3. The admin must call the liquidate function to start the liquidation process.
4. The liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain must evaluate to 0, triggering the condition to send ETH directly to the user.


### External pre-conditions

The user must have deposited collateral through a contract with a custom receive function that reverts when called by the borrowLiquidation contract.


### Attack Path

1. A malicious user deposits collateral into the protocol through a contract with a receive function.
2. The receive function is designed to revert if the caller is the borrowLiquidation contract.
3. The user’s position falls below the downside protection threshold, making it eligible for liquidation.
4. The admin calls the liquidate function to liquidate the user’s position.
5. During the execution of the `liquidationType1` function, the protocol attempts to send ETH to the user due to `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` being zero.
6. The malicious receive function reverts, causing the entire liquidation process to fail.
7. The user’s position cannot be liquidated, and the protocol can't liquidated that specific position.


### Impact

The protocol cannot liquidate the malicious user’s position, if it is below the downside protection threshold.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Wrapping the transfer in a try/catch block ensures that even if the receive function reverts, the transaction is successfully executed.
