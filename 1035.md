# Lack of access control in `updateDownsideProtected()` would lead to DOS.

### Summary

Lack of access control in `updateDownsideProtected()` would lead to DOS.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- As updateDownsideProtected() has no access control attacker would call this function and would update the downsideProtected value to uint(128).max - 1
```solidity
function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```
- As now downsideProtected is set as max value by attacker there will be multiple places where functions would revert
- Like in deposit() in CDS.sol
- Inside deposit() _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() gets called.
```solidity
function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
            totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }
```
- Now as attacker has set downsideProtected value to max value , totalCdsDepositedAmount would be less than downsideProtected value due to that underflow would happen and the deposit() would revert
- Same happens with withdraw() as well and the withdraw() would also revert.
- Thus Total DOS as user's will not be able to work with core functionality

### Impact

Permanent DOS of deposit() , withdraw() in Cds.sol due to missing access control.
The Bug is of high impact because in worst scenario whenever users want to withdraw due to some situation he would not be able to do it as the withdraw() would also revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control to `updateDownsideProtected()`
