# Critical State Handling Vulnerability in TransferFrom Function

### Summary

An Issue in the ``transferFrom`` function leads to erroneous state updates for the ``msg.sender`` instead of the intended from address. This results in significant accounting discrepancies, which can cause permanent loss of funds, overinflated balances, and denial of service (DoS) for affected accounts. The issue can be mitigated by correcting the state assignment to properly update the from address.



### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises from improper assignment of the updated state to ``msg.sender`` rather than the ``from`` address. This leads to overwriting of the wrong userâ€™s state in the ``userStates`` mapping.
The vulnerability occurs in the following segment of the ``transferFrom`` function:

```solidity
// update sender state
fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState; // Erroneous assignment
```
This line incorrectly assigns the updated ``fromState`` to the ``msg.sender``, overwriting their state instead of updating the from address. The rest of the function logic exacerbates the issue by treating the overwritten state as valid for subsequent operations.

### Attack Path

### Impact

- **Internal Accounting Errors**: Incorrect state assignment introduces inconsistencies.
- **Permanent Fund Loss**: User balances can be irrecoverably lost.
- **Overinflated Balances**: If ``fromState`` balance > ``msg.sender`` state balance, balances can be artificially inflated.

```solidity
  function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        // check the input params are non zero
        require(from != address(0) && to != address(0), "Invalid User");

        // get the sender and receiver state
        State memory fromState = userStates[from];
        State memory toState = userStates[to];

        // update receiver state
        toState = Colors._credit(fromState, toState, uint128(value));
        userStates[to] = toState;

        // update sender state
        fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
  @>      userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;

        // transfer abond
        super.transferFrom(from, to, value);
        return true;
    }
```
### Mitigation

```diff
- userStates[msg.sender] = fromState;
+ userStates[from] = fromState;
```
