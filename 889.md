# Value Extraction Through CDS Deposit/Withdraw Manipulation

## Summary

The CDS system allows positions to be opened and closed based on cumulative value calculations that are vulnerable to manipulation. At the core of this vulnerability lies the cumulative value tracking mechanism used for profit/loss calculations. An attacker can systematically manipulate these calculations through precisely timed deposits and withdrawals, extracting excess value from the protocol at the expense of other depositors.

The attack leverages the lack of timelock mechanisms and value change validations to artificially inflate withdrawal amounts. Through flash loan leveraged positions, an attacker could potentially extract up to 90% of the protocol's TVL.

The vulnerability centers around the profit/loss calculation mechanism in `cdsAmountToReturn`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L442

```solidity
function cdsAmountToReturn(
    address _user, 
    uint64 index,
    uint128 cumulativeValue,
    bool cumulativeValueSign, 
    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue
) private view returns (uint256) {
    // Vulnerable profit calculation
    if (cumulativeValueAtDeposit > cumulativeValueAtWithdraw) {
        uint256 loss = (depositedAmount * valDiff) / 1e11;
        return (depositedAmount - loss); 
    } else {
        uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;
        return (depositedAmount + profit);
    }
}
```

The core issue stems from the protocol's reliance on instantaneous value calculations without temporal smoothing or manipulation safeguards. This enables value extraction through rapid state changes. When combined with external oracle price manipulation, the attack surface expands significantly.

The excessProfitCumulativeValue parameter, intended as a safeguard, proves insufficient as it can be bypassed through careful transaction timing and value manipulation. The protocol's lack of deposit/withdrawal rate limiting further compounds this vulnerability.

## Proof of Concept

The attack execution follows a systematic pattern:

The attacker first secures a large flash loan position to establish significant protocol influence. They then execute a series of rapid deposits and withdrawals, each carefully timed to incrementally push the cumulative value higher. The final withdrawal of their main position captures the artificially inflated value, extracting excess profit from the protocol.

The attack's profitability stems from the compound effect of manipulation across multiple parameters - cumulative values, oracle prices, and withdrawal timing. The lack of temporal safeguards allows all these manipulations to occur within minimal timeframes, often within the same block.

## Recommended Mitigations 

The mitigation strategy requires a multi-layered approach focused on temporal safeguards and value validation:

The protection mechanism must be implemented as an interconnected system where timelock delays work in conjunction with TWAP calculations and rate limiting. This creates multiple layers of defense against manipulation attempts.

Value change limits should be implemented with dynamic thresholds that adjust based on market conditions and protocol TVL. Rate limiting should similarly adapt to protocol usage patterns while maintaining strict upper bounds on state change frequency.

These protections should be further reinforced by robust monitoring and circuit breaker systems that can detect and prevent suspicious activity patterns before significant value extraction occurs.

The immediate priority should be implementing temporal safeguards to prevent rapid state manipulation, followed by systematic value validation mechanisms. This provides essential protection while more sophisticated defenses are developed and deployed.



Implement mandatory timelock between deposits and withdrawals:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastDepositTime;
uint256 public constant WITHDRAWAL_TIMELOCK = 1 days;

function withdraw(uint64 index, uint256 nonce, bytes calldata signature) external {
    require(
        block.timestamp >= lastDepositTime[msg.sender] + WITHDRAWAL_TIMELOCK,
        "Withdrawal timelock active"
    );
    // ... rest of withdrawal logic
}
```

Add TWAP for cumulative value calculations:

```solidity
struct ValuePoint {
    uint256 value;
    uint256 timestamp;
}

ValuePoint[] public valueHistory;
uint256 public constant TWAP_WINDOW = 1 hours;
uint256 public constant MIN_TWAP_POINTS = 5;

function pushValue(uint256 _value) internal {
    valueHistory.push(ValuePoint({
        value: _value,
        timestamp: block.timestamp
    }));
}

function getTwapValue() public view returns (uint256) {
    require(valueHistory.length >= MIN_TWAP_POINTS, "Insufficient price points");
    
    uint256 length = valueHistory.length;
    uint256 totalValue;
    uint256 timeWeightedValue;
    
    for(uint i = length - MIN_TWAP_POINTS; i < length - 1; i++) {
        uint256 timeWeight = valueHistory[i+1].timestamp - valueHistory[i].timestamp;
        timeWeightedValue += valueHistory[i].value * timeWeight;
        totalValue += timeWeight;
    }
    
    return timeWeightedValue / totalValue;
}
```

Implement value change limits:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_VALUE_CHANGE_BPS = 1000; // 10%

function validateValueChange(uint256 oldValue, uint256 newValue) internal pure {
    uint256 minValue = oldValue * (10000 - MAX_VALUE_CHANGE_BPS) / 10000;
    uint256 maxValue = oldValue * (10000 + MAX_VALUE_CHANGE_BPS) / 10000;
    require(
        newValue >= minValue && newValue <= maxValue,
        "Value change exceeds limits"
    );
}
```

Add rate limiting on deposits:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public depositCount;
mapping(address => uint256) public lastDepositReset;
uint256 public constant MAX_DEPOSITS_PER_HOUR = 3;
uint256 public constant DEPOSIT_WINDOW = 1 hours;

modifier depositRateLimit() {
    if(block.timestamp >= lastDepositReset[msg.sender] + DEPOSIT_WINDOW) {
        depositCount[msg.sender] = 0;
        lastDepositReset[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    }
    require(depositCount[msg.sender] < MAX_DEPOSITS_PER_HOUR, "Deposit rate limit exceeded");
    depositCount[msg.sender]++;
    _;
}
```
