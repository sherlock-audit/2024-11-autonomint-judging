# Underflow Risk in `cdsProfits` Calculation Due to Borrower Debt Growth in the borrowing `liquidate` function

### Summary

The `cdsProfits` calculation subtracts `returnToTreasury` and `returnToAbond` from a value derived from the initial collateral `(depositedAmountInETH * ethPriceAtDeposit)`. However, as `borrowerDebt` grows over time due to increasing `lastCumulativeRate`, the `returnToTreasury` (equal to uint128(borrowerDebt)) can exceed the initial collateral value. This causes the `cdsProfits` calculation to underflow when the subtraction results in a negative value, leading to a revert.

### Root Cause

1. Debt Growth Over Time:
borrowerDebt grows proportionally to lastCumulativeRate. Since lastCumulativeRate accumulates over time, borrowerDebt can eventually surpass the initial collateral value (depositedAmountInETH * ethPriceAtDeposit).

2. Unbounded Increase:
The calculation does not account for the possibility that borrowerDebt may grow unboundedly over a long period of time, especially when interest rates are high or borrowers delay repayment.

3. Unsigned Integer Arithmetic:
In Solidity, unsigned integers cannot represent negative values, so subtracting a larger number from a smaller one results in an underflow, reverting the transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower delays repayment for an extended period, allowing lastCumulativeRate to grow.
2. Also the ethPrice never drops to make ratio <= 8000. Hence, liquidation not occur for a while
3. As lastCumulativeRate increases, borrowerDebt rises to a point where returnToTreasury exceeds the value derived from the initial collateral.
4. The system attempts to calculate cdsProfits, triggering an underflow when subtracting returnToTreasury from the collateral-based value.
5. All calculation calculateReturnToAbond may also underflow

### Impact

1. The borrower collateral gets locked in the contract, as all the required variables cannot be updated for the distribution of collateral.

### Mitigation

1. Input Validation and Bounds Checking:

Before performing the cdsProfits calculation, ensure returnToTreasury + returnToAbond does not exceed the collateral-based value:
solidity
Copy code
uint128 collateralValue = (((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit) / BorrowLib.USDA_PRECISION) / 100);
require(returnToTreasury + returnToAbond <= collateralValue, "Debt exceeds collateral value");
If the condition fails, handle the error gracefully (e.g., pause withdrawals, notify users).

2. Cap Debt Growth:
Introduce a mechanism to cap borrowerDebt or the cumulative rate at a value proportional to the collateral.
