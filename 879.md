# Missing Storage Gaps in Upgradeable Contracts

### Summary

The contracts does not include storage gaps to ensure compatibility with potential future upgrades. When using upgradeable contracts, especially with inheritance, storage layouts must remain consistent across contract upgrades to prevent storage slot collisions, which could lead to undefined or erroneous behavior.

In the provided contracts, storage gaps are absent, particularly in the parent contract inheritance structure, which increases the risk of storage layout conflicts during upgrades.
