# redeemUSDT does not have slippage protection

### Summary

The `redeemUSDT` function uses the exchange rate to determine the amount of `USDT` to be returned for the deposited `USDA`. However, it currently lacks a slippage parameter.

**Note:** _Currently, prices are passed directly through the function, which is incorrect and constitutes a separate vulnerability leading to potential theft of funds. Prices should be retrieved from an oracle. However, this issue is distinct, as fixing the oracle-related issue does not address the lack of slippage protection._

### Root Cause

No slippage control in the `redeemUSDT` function in `CDS.sol` could result in redeemers receiving less `USDT` than expected, especially in the case of a de-peg.  
This vulnerability is particularly concerning because the `USDT` redemption functionality is designed to control peg stability, as noted in the documentation:

[Stablecoin Peg Stability - Managing Stablecoin Demand](https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/stablecoin-peg-stability)  
> 5. Immediate re-deemability - Users can re-deem USDa to get USDT immediately in case the price falls below $1.

### Internal Preconditions

_No response_

### External Preconditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- A user redeems `USDT`.
- Due to the de-peg of `USDA`, the user receives less `USDT` than expected because of varying exchange rates.
- This issue can also occur during rapid exchange rate fluctuations when no slippage protection is in place.

### Impact

Users may receive an unexpected amount of `USDT`. This issue does not require a full de-peg to occur, as price spikes in both upward and downward directions are common when dealing with on-chain exchange rates. The lack of slippage control exacerbates the risk.

### Mitigation

Add a slippage parameter to the `redeemUSDT` function.
