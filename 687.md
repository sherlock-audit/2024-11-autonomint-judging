# The interest from external protocol during liquidation is stuck without a way to withdraw

### Summary

During liquidation interest from funds deposited to external protocol is accrued and stored in  [`interestFromExternalProtocolDuringLiquidation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L486) as part of the funds withdrawn from external protocols in to treasury.

### Root Cause

The problem is that [this fund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L294-L296) is forever stuck in the `Treasury` contract as there is no way to withdraw it


```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
293:         // If the collateral is ETH, withdraw the deposited ETH in external protocol
294:         if (depositDetail.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
295:   @>        treasury.updateInterestFromExternalProtocol(treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocolDuringLiq(user, index));
296:         }


File: Treasury.sol
483:     function updateInterestFromExternalProtocol(
484:         uint256 amount
485:     ) external onlyCoreContracts {
486:  @>     interestFromExternalProtocolDuringLiquidation += amount;
487:     }


```
