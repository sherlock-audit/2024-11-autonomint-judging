# sUSD will be locked in the borrowLiquidation

### Summary

When we close short position in Synthetix, we will get back sUSD. But we lack interface to withdraw sUSD.

### Root Cause

In [borrowLiquidation.sol:371](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L371-L386), admin can close the short position according to the market.

The problem is that the short position will be closed and return sUSD back to the borrowLiquidation contract. But we don't have any methods to withdraw sUSD. These sUSD will be locked in the contract.

```solidity
    function closeThePositionInSynthetix() external onlyAdmin {
        // call closeThePositionInSynthetix in borrowLiquidation contract
        borrowLiquidation.closeThePositionInSynthetix();
    }
    function closeThePositionInSynthetix() external onlyBorrowingContract {
        (, uint128 ethPrice) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH));
        // Submit an order to close all positions in synthetix
        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(-synthetixPerpsV2.positions(address(this)).size, ethPrice * 1e16);
    }

```
