# Liquidation type 1 is prone to underflow Revert DoS.

### Summary

The calculation of `yields` in the `liquidationType1` process can lead to an underflow revert DoS, potentially preventing admin from liquidating the borrower's position. This revert situation can keep occurring for a long time causing a denial-of-service situation for the liquidation type 1 process.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the subtraction operation in the `yields` calculation, which will always revert when the current `exchangeRate` will be less than the exchange rate of (borrower's Asset / ETH) at the time of borrower's deposit. 

**NOTE: liquidations happen only when the current asset price falls below the asset price at deposited by 0.8 ratio. | So here we can also say that the Asset/ETH current exchange rate must have fallen from what it was before at the time of borrow's deposit** 

- Now coming to the flow back ->

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L187) Current ongoing `exchangeRate` is calculated inside function `liquidationType1`:

```solidity
(uint128 exchangeRate, /*uint128 ethPrice*/ ) =
borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));
```

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L265) now Yeild calculation happens, where underflow will definitely happen, whenever the `exchangeRate` value will be lesser than what it was at the time of deposit. 

```solidity 
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

We can see how `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH` at the time of deposit was calculated like this [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L655) -> 

We can see it is calculated with "exchangeRate" that was going on that time of deposit, that is later on set as `depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`.

```solidity
uint256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```

Here value of `((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate)` is going to be bigger than value of `depositDetail.depositedAmount`.

So when this subtraction happens at that time underflow revert will happen.

### Internal pre-conditions

when the current `exchangeRate` will be less than the exchange rate of (borrower's Asset / ETH) at the time of the borrower's deposit.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

So real `yeilds` calculations, where this will revert -> 

Real example values -> depositDetail.depositedAmount = 1e18 , depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH = 1.02e18 , exchangeRate = 1.01e18

```solidity
int256 yields = depositDetail.depositedAmount - ((depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH * 1 ether) / exchangeRate);
```
calculations ->

1e18 - ((1.02e18 * 1e18) / 1.01e18) => Underflow REVERT.

### Impact

- Admin won't be able to execute function `LiquidationType1` to liquidate borrower even when borrower's "borrowing Health" was bad, leading to bad debt inside protocol.
- It can result in financial losses for the protocol and CDS participants as they get profit from liquidation.
- This can lead to unfair advantages for borrowers who deposited at favorable rates.
