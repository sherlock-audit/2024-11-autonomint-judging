# Downside protection never ends, so renewing options is useless and `CDS` depositors are unfairly rewarded.

### Summary

One of the key components is that a `dCDS` position allows one to swap the credit/default risk in exchange for some periodic fixed fees. In the current implementation, there is only an upfront fee paid by borrowers that lasts forever because the system is not handling the case where the hedge is lapsed, which is not expected behavior because the `Borrowing::renewOptions` function is there to allow user renew their downside protection. Expired protection should reflect in the liquidation and in the withdrawal flow because health factor is affected.

### Root Cause

In the `Borrowing::renewOptions` function, the user expects to pay to renew the downside protection for 30 days:
[borrowing.sol#L555-L602](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L555-L602)
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev renew the position by 30 days by paying usda.
     * The user will have 80% downside protection
     * @param index index of the position to renew
     */
    function renewOptions(uint64 index) external payable {
        if (
            !BorrowLib.renewOptions(
                Interfaces(
                    treasury,
                    globalVariables,
                    usda,
                    abond,
                    cds,
                    options
                ),
                index
            )
        ) revert Borrow_RenewFailed();
        
        // Get the deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
        treasury.updateDepositDetails(msg.sender, index, depositDetail);
	       
		...
		
		emit Renewed(msg.sender, index, block.timestamp);
    }
```

After payment, the deposit of the user at the `index` is updated: ` depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp = block.timestamp;`.

However, that payment to renew the position has zero effect in the protocol behavior. 

In the withdrawal flow, the `borrowingHealth` is calculated based on the difference in prices of ETH:
[BorrowLib.sol#L818-L819](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L818-L819)
```solidity
// Calculate the borrowingHealth
uint128 borrowingHealth = calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, params.ethPrice);
```

Additionally, the downside protection is calculated as follows, not taking into account protection expiring: 
[BorrowLib.sol#L94-L104](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L94-L104)
```solidity
    function calculateDownsideProtected(
        uint128 amount,
        uint128 currentEthPrice,
        uint128 depositEthPrice
    ) public pure returns (uint128) {
        if (currentEthPrice < depositEthPrice) {
            return (amount * (depositEthPrice - currentEthPrice)) / (100 * USDA_PRECISION);
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
```

The protocol is failing to consider the cases in which:
- `user` `borrowingHealth > 1`, but downside protection is expired
- `user` `borrowingHealth < 1`, but downside protection is expired
- `user` `borrowingHealth == 1`, but downside protection is expired

The same thing occurs in the liquidation flow. 
In liquidation type one and two: 
[borrowLiquidation.sol#L190-L191](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L190-L191)[borrowLiquidation.sol#L334-L336](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L334-L336)
```solidity
uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
require(ratio <= 8000,"You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");
```
This check does not consider the case in which accounts have an expired downside protection.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

- `CDS` depositors are rewarded with less than they should be.
- `Borrowing::renewOptions` is useless as is all the renewing options expected behavior.
- Downside protection lasts forever and is considered in `Borrowing::withDraw` and in `Borrowing::liquidate` as amount in favor of the borrower.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

This will require a change in code and functions design.
- Handle the case in `Borrowing::liquidate` and `Borrowing::withdraw` where downside protection expires or gets reduced.
