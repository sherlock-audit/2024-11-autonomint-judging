# renewOptions deadline if-check is invalid and will never revert

### Summary
The `renewOptions` functionality for borrowers has an invalid if-check for the renewal deadline, which means it will never revert.

### Root Cause
In [BorrowLib.sol#L616-L642](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L616-L642), the function calls `uint256 optionsFeesNeedsToPay = getOptionFeesToPay(interfaces.treasury, index);`, which is also supposed to check the deadline for the option fees.  
However, the current implementation is incorrect, as it does not allow for a revert when the deadline has passed.
```solidity
    function getOptionFeesToPay(
        ITreasury treasury,
        uint64 index
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        // Get the deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(msg.sender, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;

        // check if borrowerIndex in BorrowerDetails of the msg.sender is greater than or equal to Index
        if (getBorrowingResult.totalIndex >= index) {
            // check the position is not withdrew or liquidated
            if (depositDetail.withdrawed && depositDetail.liquidated)
                revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyWithdrewOrLiquidated();

            // check the user is eligible to renew position
            if (
@>>          block.timestamp <
@>>             depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
@>>             block.timestamp >
@>>             depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();

            // calculate time difference from deposit to current time
            uint256 secondsPassedSinceDeposit = block.timestamp - depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp;

            // calculate options fees per second
            uint128 optionsFeesPerSec = calculateOptionsFeesPerSec(depositDetail.optionFees);

            // calculate options fees needs to pay by multiplying timw difference and options fees per second
            //? i.e position will be renewed for 30 days from now. If 10 days have been passed since deposit,
            //? then the total validity for 80% LTV is 40 days from deposit
            uint256 optionsFeesNeedsToPay = (optionsFeesPerSec * secondsPassedSinceDeposit) / OPTIONS_FEES_PRECISION;

            //return options fees needs to pay
            return optionsFeesNeedsToPay;
        } else {
            // revert if the entered index is not present for the borrower
            revert IBorrowing.Borrow_InvalidIndex();
        }
    }
```

We cannot possibly have `block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days` and `block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days` both be true at the same time.

### Attack Path
_No response_

### Impact
Borrowers can always bypass the deadline for options renewal, meaning there is no restriction on when the option fees can be renewed. This allows the renewal to occur even past the deadline.
