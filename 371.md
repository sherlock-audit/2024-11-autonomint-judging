# Users can't access their deposits in function withdraw

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L226C5-L276C6

Users can't access their deposits in function withdraw

### Root Cause

require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
The current logic says:

IF the deposit is already withdrawn (withdrawed == true)
THEN allow another withdrawal
ELSE revert with "Already withdrawn"

This is completely backwards from the intended security check.

depositDetails.withdrawed == false  // Initial state
require(false, "Already withdrawn") // Will revert

First withdrawal always fails. Even though funds are available. User can't access their deposits

Subsequent Withdrawal Attempts (if the check was somehow passed):
depositDetails.withdrawed == true   // After first withdrawal
require(true, "Already withdrawn")  // Will pass

Allows multiple withdrawals. Could drain more funds than deposited since there are no checks to compare withdrawal amount against deposit balance.
