# Profit Manipulation in CDS Withdrawal Through Unvalidated External Input

### Summary

The CDS contract's withdrawal mechanism contains a critical vulnerability that allows users to manipulate their profit calculations through an unvalidated external input parameter. This can lead to theft of funds from the protocol, affecting all depositors.

The core vulnerability stems from the architectural decision to pass external profit calculation parameters into the withdrawal function. The `withdraw` function accepts an `excessProfitCumulativeValue` that, while requiring adminTwo's signature, lacks any validation against the actual pool state or performance metrics.

This parameter flows directly into the profit calculation logic within `cdsAmountToReturn`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L476

```solidity
if (cumulativeValueAtDeposit > cumulativeValueAtWithdraw) {
    uint256 profit = (depositedAmount * (valDiff - excessProfitCumulativeValue)) / 1e11;
    return (depositedAmount + profit);
}
```

The signature verification only ensures adminTwo approved the value but fails to validate its economic soundness or relationship to actual pool performance. This creates a disconnect between authorized values and legitimate profit calculations, enabling extraction of unauthorized value from the protocol.

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would be able to drain protocol liquidity by withdrawing more value than they deposited, directly impacting other users' ability to withdraw their legitimate funds.

### Proof of Concept

Attack Flow:
1. Initial State: Attacker observes pool has 1000 ETH worth of deposits

2. Entry:
- Attacker deposits minimum required amount (e.g. 1 ETH worth)
- Creates a CDS position with minimum locking period
- Records their deposited index

3. Preparation:
- Attacker identifies/bribes/compromises adminTwo who can sign withdrawal requests
- Gets adminTwo to sign a withdrawal request with:
  - Their deposit index
  - An artificially high excessProfitCumulativeValue (e.g. 500 ETH worth)
  - Valid nonce

4. Exploit execution:
- Attacker calls withdraw() with:
  - Their valid index
  - The signed inflated excessProfitCumulativeValue 
  - The signature from adminTwo
- The withdraw function:
  - Validates signature (passes)
  - Calculates profits using the inflated value
  - Sends attacker significantly more than their 1 ETH deposit

5. Impact:
- Attacker receives ~501 ETH worth (original 1 ETH + manipulated 500 ETH profit)
- Pool is drained of 50% of liquidity
- Other users can no longer withdraw their full deposits
- Protocol's profit accounting is permanently damaged

This can be repeated with new deposits/admins until the pool is fully drained, with each cycle requiring only minimal capital risk from the attacker.

Key enabler is that the signature only validates the numerical inputs exist, not that they reflect legitimate protocol profits.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The fundamental fix requires restructuring how profit calculations are performed in the withdrawal process. The protocol should transition to using verifiable on-chain data rather than external inputs for profit determination.

A secure implementation would derive profit calculations from the protocol's actual performance metrics:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint64 index, uint256 nonce, bytes memory signature) external {
    uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue = calculateVerifiableExcessProfit();
    // Continue with withdrawal using internally calculated value
}
```

If external parameters must be maintained for flexibility, implement comprehensive validation:

```solidity
function validateExcessProfit(uint256 excessProfitCumulativeValue) internal view {
    require(excessProfitCumulativeValue <= calculateMaxAllowedExcessProfit(), "Invalid excess profit");
    require(excessProfitCumulativeValue <= getHistoricalMaxProfit(), "Exceeds historical maximum");
    require(
        excessProfitCumulativeValue <= getTimeWeightedAverageProfit(),
        "Exceeds average performance"
    );
}
```

These validations should be based on actual pool metrics, historical performance data, and time-weighted calculations to ensure profit distributions remain within legitimate bounds of protocol performance.
