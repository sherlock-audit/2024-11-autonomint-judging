# Ever-Increasing vaultValue in `calculateRatio` Causes Unnecessary Reverts for New Depositors

### Summary

The [`calculateRatio`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L203) calculates the ratio to check if new deposits are permissible using the formula 
```javascript
        uint64 ratio = uint64((currentCDSPoolValue * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / currentVaultValue);
```
the problem is that 
```javascript
currentVaultValue = previousData.vaultValue + (amount * currentEthPrice);
```
keep growing after each deposit, The `Borrowing::Withdraw` never decreases this amount; This can creates a situation where the ratio check fails for new borrowing depositors, even if the remaining CDS pool is sufficient to cover their downside protection. This behavior results in unnecessary reverts, discouraging new deposits and reducing protocol usability.



### Root Cause

1. Ever-Increasing vaultValue:

The vaultValue is updated as follows:
```javascript
currentVaultValue = previousData.vaultValue + (amount * currentEthPrice);
previousData.vaultValue = currentVaultValue;
```
2. ratio is calculated as:
```javascript
uint64 ratio = uint64((currentCDSPoolValue * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / currentVaultValue);
```
3. Ratio keep increasing, even if everybody has withdrawn their positions from `Borrowing`, this canc ause a scenario where it only takes to cds users to withdraw their deposits (decreast `totalCdsDepositedAmount`) And the ratio will revert for future deposits in `Borrowing`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrowing users deposit funds, causing `vaultValue` to increase.
2. Borrowing users decides to withdraw their positions.
3. Cds users decides to withdraw their deposits causing the ratio to be less than 2.
4. A user wants to deposit in borrowing, however the ratio fails even if there are no other borrowing positions and the current cdsPool is enough for `downsideProtection` because `vaultValue` still accounts previous positions

### Impact

Dos of the borrowing protocol as New deposits are rejected even when the CDS pool has sufficient funds, reducing protocol usability.


### PoC

Assume the following state:

vaultValue = 100,000
1. People withdraw their positions from `Borrowing` (the real vault value is 1000 for example)
2. After  CDS withdrawals,  totalCDSPool = 5000

3. A new user attempts to deposit 1,000 with currentEthPrice = 2,000.

The ratio is calculated as:
```javascript 
uint64 ratio = uint64((5,000 * CUMULATIVE_PRECISION) / 100,000);
```
the ratio is too low and the deposit will revert


### Mitigation

Adjust `vaultValue` after withdrawals to reflect the actual active collateral .
