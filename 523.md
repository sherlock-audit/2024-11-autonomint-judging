# Reenterancy in `redeemYields()` function

### Summary

Reenterancy in `redeemYields()` function allows to drain protocol, because there is no `nonReentrant()` modifier, and ETH sent to user first, then `abond` token burned from user.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L1028-L1035)

If user wants to receive ETH, he can redeem eth yields from ext protocol by returning `abond` tokens owned. The issue is there is no `nonReentrant()` modifier, and ETH sent to user first, then `abond` token burned from user. User can inject any malicious code in his `receive()` function, and call `redeemYields()` again, thus drain protocol by receiving ETH many times and burn his `abond` tokens once.
```solidity
 function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {
//...

        // withdraw eth from ext protocol
        uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

        //Burn the abond from user
        bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount);
        if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

        return withdrawAmount;
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

`userState.aBondBalance` > 0
User must have some `abond` tokens to redeem ETH.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- User calls `redeemYields()`
- After receiving ETH, user's contract calls `redeemYields()` again
- Attack will continue untill treasury has enough `usda` tokens to burn

### Impact

Malicious user can drain all ETH from the protocol through reentrancy.

### PoC

Although I was unable to run a test to prove reentrancy with code, I will try to explain it in words. It is possible due to the following reasons:

- `redeemYields()` has no `nonReentrant()` modifier
- calculations of `usdaToBurn` and `usdaToTransfer` and updating their balances in treasury can't stop the reentrancy, it can can only affect on some variables calculations, no more
- similary burning `usda` from treasury does not affect the second enter in the function
- also `withdrawFromExternalProtocol` has no `nonReentrant()` modifier

### Mitigation

```diff
 function redeemYields(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount,
        address usdaAddress,
        address abondAddress,
        address treasuryAddress,
        address borrow
    ) public returns (uint256) {
//...

-       // withdraw eth from ext protocol
-       uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

        //Burn the abond from user
        bool success = abond.burnFromUser(msg.sender, aBondAmount);
        if (!success) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BurnFailed();

+       // withdraw eth from ext protocol
+       uint256 withdrawAmount = treasury.withdrawFromExternalProtocol(user,aBondAmount);

        return withdrawAmount;
}
```
