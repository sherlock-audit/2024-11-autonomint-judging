# Incorrect Tracking of `omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow`

### Summary

The variable `omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow` is incremented in the CDS `deposit` function to track the total USDT deposited into the protocol. However, it is not decremented when users redeem USDT through the CDS redeem function. This oversight causes the value of `usdtAmountDepositedTillNow` to perpetually increase, even when funds are withdrawn. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the protocol, particularly in the logic that restricts deposits based on `params.usdtLimit`.

### Root Cause

The CDS `redeemUSDT` function, which removes USDT from the protocol, does not decrement the `omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow` variable. Consequently, the variable inaccurately reflects the total amount of USDT currently held in the protocol. This creates a mismatch between the recorded deposits and the actual USDT funds available.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Users deposit USDT through the CDS deposit function, incrementing `omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow`.

2. Users later redeem USDT, but the variable `usdtAmountDepositedTillNow` remains unchanged.

3. Over time, as deposit occur, `omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow` continues to grow beyond the actual total USDT in the protocol.

4. When performing a CDS deposit, the condition:

becomes inaccurate, forcing administrators to increase the params.usdtLimit unnecessarily.

### Impact

Operational Issues: Administrators are forced to continuously increase `params.usdtLimit`, creating a manual overhead. Else, USDT deposit will be forever blocked. and only usda can be deposited.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the redeem function to decrement omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow by the redeemed amount:
```solidity
omniChainData.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow -= usdtAmount;
```
