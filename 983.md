# The protocol does not consider Sythetix exchange fees during liquidation

### Summary

Per the [synthetix docs](https://docs.synthetix.io/v2x/synthetix-protocol/the-synthetix-protocol/synthetix-litepaper#claiming-fees)

> When Synthetix liquidity is used to exchange through the Synthetix contract, a fee is extracted and sent to the fee pool to be claimed by SNX stakers

However, the protocol does not consider that this fee was deducted during the [asset exchange](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L350-L359) and goes on to evalute the margin with the `amount` of the output asset which must now be less than the input asset amount due to fees.

```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
350:         synthetix.exchange(
351:             0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
352:             amount,
353:             0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
354:         );
355: 
356:         // Calculate the margin
357:  @>     int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);

```

### Root Cause



When [`exchange`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/38e88383bbaf9f07c5f473fcf0252ab19d32da5f/contracts/BaseSynthetix.sol#L202) is called, 

```solidity
    function exchange(
        bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey,
        uint sourceAmount,
        bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey
    ) external exchangeActive(sourceCurrencyKey, destinationCurrencyKey) optionalProxy returns (uint amountReceived) {
    @>    (amountReceived, ) = exchanger().exchange(
            messageSender,
            messageSender,
            sourceCurrencyKey,
            sourceAmount,
            destinationCurrencyKey,
            messageSender,
            false,
            messageSender,
            bytes32(0)
        );
    }
```

the [`exchanger`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/38e88383bbaf9f07c5f473fcf0252ab19d32da5f/contracts/Exchanger.sol#L226) contract does the account to ensure fee are accounted for.

```solidity
  @>      (amountReceived, fee, vSynth) = _exchange(
            exchangeForAddress,
            sourceSettings,
            sourceAmount,
            destinationSettings,
            destinationAddress,
            virtualSynth
        );
```

This [`fee`s are removed](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/38e88383bbaf9f07c5f473fcf0252ab19d32da5f/contracts/Exchanger.sol#L385-L386) from the output currency which in this case is sUSD

```solidity
        // Note: `fee` is denominated in the destinationCurrencyKey.
        fee = entry.destinationAmount.sub(amountReceived);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This can lead to a DOS since the sUSD amount can be less than the actual amount of sUSD received as `transferMargin()` will attempt to remove more than the actual available amount

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider transferring the exact amount of margin asset instead of the `amount` being transferred herein
