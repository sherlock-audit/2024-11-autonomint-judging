# Transferring margin is implemented incorrectly in `liquidationType2`

### Summary

liquidationType2 takes 50% of a liquidated user's collateral and transfers it to Synthethix. To do that it first must convert the collateral into WETH and after that the WETH to sETH. After that the sETH is converted into sUSD and transferred as margin. The issue is that the call to transferMargin will be incorrect as the margin being transferred will be wrong.

### Root Cause

In `liquidationType2` the `synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin` is provided `margin` as a the amount of margin to transfer. This is how `margin` is calculated:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L357

```solidity
int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
```

As we can see, it is calculated as the amount of sETH exhchanged for sUSD scaled by the ETH's price in USD.
This is problematic as the sUSD received when exchanging sETH will always be different than that amount. This happens because sUSD has a lower price than USD, thus the sUSD received from exchanging sETH will likely be higher. As a result, the margin transferred will be lower than intended.

### Attack Path

1. User gets liquidated through `liquidationType2`.
2. The sETH converted into sUSD is not entirely transferred as margin.
3. The leftover sUSD will not be used in the short position.

### Impact

sUSD will remain stuck in the Treasury, not being utilized in the Synthethix short position, raising the risk of lost possible yield.

### Mitigation

Get the amount of sUSD received from the exchange of sETH by examining the sUSD balance of the protocol before and after the exchange and use that value when transferring margin.
