# USDT does not return any value on transfer, which means that all transfer and transferFrom operations will fail.

### Summary

The protocol uses the USDT token as one of its main tokens, as stated in the README. However, the problem lies in how transfers are implemented for this token. USDT is an unusual token that does not return any value after `transferFrom`. The protocol checks if the return value is `true`, which means this condition will fail 100% of the time.

### Root Cause

The USDT token implementation does not return a boolean value after a transfer because it does not follow certain default ERC-20 guidelines. This means that any attempt to check the returned value will result in false.

### Internal pre-conditions

Any USDT transfer made by using transferFrom/transfer.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

All instances where plain transfer or transferFrom are used for USDT will fail, blocking execution every time USDT is transferred.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer` implementation instead.
