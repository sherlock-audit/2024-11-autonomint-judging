# Negative Price Reporting in Chainlink Oracle Data Result in Wrong ETH price and Exchange rate

### Summary

The `MasterPriceOracle` contract does not handle scenarios where the price returned by the Chainlink oracle is negative, which can result in incorrect conversion of deposit tokens to ETH prices for tracking purposes.




### Root Cause

The absence of validation checks for negative price values when retrieving data from the Chainlink oracle using the latestRoundData() function.

```solidity
        } else if (block.chainid == 10) {
            AggregatorV3Interface oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(oracles[underlying]);

            // Get the eth price
 @>         (, int256 price_, , , ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
            // If the token is ETH
            if (underlying == assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]) {
                // Return Exchange rate as 1 and ETH price with 2 decimals
@>              return (1 ether, uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)));
            } else {
                (, uint128 ethPrice) = _price(assetAddress[IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH]);
                // Return Exchange rate and ETH price with 2 decimals
                return (uint128(uint256(price_)), ethPrice);
            }
        } else {
```

Negative prices are implicitly converted to large positive values when cast from int256 to uint256, leading to incorrect data processing.

Eg: If price_ is `-1` then 

`uint256(price_) = 2^256 - 1 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935`

`ethPrice = uint128((uint256(price_) / 1e6)) = 71954748179633963730111340989091978921`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Anomalies or errors in the Chainlink oracle feed causing it to return a negative price value.

### Attack Path

1. The Chainlink oracle returns a negative price for a token due to data feed errors or manipulation.
2. The contract processes this negative price, converting it to a large positive value due to the int256 to uint256 conversion.
3. This results in grossly inaccurate conversion of deposit tokens to ETH prices, affecting tracking and reporting.

### Impact

1. Incorrect tracking of token values in ETH due to large positive values throghout the protocol.
2. Potential accounting issues in depositing collaterals and withdrawing collaterals in `Borrowing` contract
3. Potential accounting issue in `CDS` contract, especially in deposit() function and yield calculation


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement validation checks to ensure that prices retrieved from Chainlink oracles are non-negative.
