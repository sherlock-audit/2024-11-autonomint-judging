# wrong calculation in function calculateDiscountedETH

### Summary

The function **calculateDiscountedETH** in **borrowlib** is used to calculate 80% of the half amount. The problem here is that after multiplying by 80, it doesn't subtract from 100, which means that it is multiplying the half amount by 80 and then setting it to **discountedCollateral**. However, due to the large amount of the variable **discountedCollateral** in line 867, it will revert, as it is subtracting a large amount from a small amount.
