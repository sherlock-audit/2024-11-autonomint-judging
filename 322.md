# Missing Multi-Signature Validation in `borrowing.sol::setOptions()`

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L188-L193

The `setOptions` function in the Borrowing contract allows a single admin to change the options contract address without requiring multi-signature approval, deviating from the security pattern established in other critical setter functions like `setTreasury`.

## Impact
A compromised admin account could unilaterally deploy and set a malicious options contract that could manipulate protocol parameters and options-related functionality, bypassing the multi-signature security model intended to protect the protocol from unauthorized changes.

## Recommendations
Implement multi-signature requirement for options contract updates
