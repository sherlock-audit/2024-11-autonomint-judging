# `depositedAmount` Not Updated in `treasury::deposit` Function, Leading to Incorrect Behavior in `treasury::withdraw`

### Summary

the [`deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L154) updates the `borrowing[user].depositDetails[borrowerIndex]`, this object is a 
```javascript
 //Depositor's Details for each depsoit.
    struct DepositDetails {
        uint64 depositedTime;
        uint128 depositedAmountInETH;
        uint128 depositedAmountUsdValue;
        uint64 downsidePercentage;
        uint128 ethPriceAtDeposit;
        uint128 borrowedAmount;
        uint128 normalizedAmount;
        bool withdrawed;
        uint128 withdrawAmount;
        bool liquidated;
        uint64 ethPriceAtWithdraw;
        uint64 withdrawTime;
        uint128 aBondTokensAmount;
        uint128 strikePrice;
        uint128 optionFees;
        uint8 APR;
        uint256 totalDebtAmountPaid;
        uint256 aBondCr;
        IBorrowing.AssetName assetName;
        uint128 exchangeRateAtDeposit;
        uint128 depositedAmount; \\ not updated in the deposit function but used in withdraw
        uint256 optionsRenewedTimeStamp;
    }
```
the problem is that the function fails to go through all the fields, this will cause issues in `Withdraw` function, to be more specific  it fails for update `borrowing[user].depositDetails[borrowerIndex].depositedAmount` and `borrowing[user].depositDetails[borrowerIndex].borrowedAmount`

### Root Cause

To be more specific the [`Withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L261) calls 
```javascript
            bool sent = IERC20(borrow.assetAddress(depositDetails.assetName)).transfer(toAddress, depositDetails.depositedAmount - upsideToDeduct);
```
Since `depositDetails.depositedAmount` is never initialized in the `deposit` function, it'll be eqaul to 0 meaning the withdraw function will revert for each time the Asset is not `ETH`. Another instance where `depositedAmount` si called is in [`withdrawFromExternalProtocolDuringLiq`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L315), this function is used to update the intrest from external protocol in[`liqudiation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L295).
For the `borrowedAmount`:
```javascript
        borrowing[borrower].totalBorrowedAmount -= depositDetails.borrowedAmount;
```
This means the `totalBorrowedAmount` is never decreased. 
### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `deposit` function is called with valid parameters.
The `withdraw` function uses the `depositedAmount` and `totalBorrowedAmount` field of `DepositDetails` for calculations.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Dos of the withdrawal feature in `borrowing` for assets that are not `ETH`. Users are unable to withdraw their collateral due to incorrect calculations in the withdraw function.
OverEvaluation of the intrest from external protocol in the liquidations.
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure the depositedAmount field is updated when a deposit is made:
```javascript
borrowing[user].depositDetails[borrowerIndex].depositedAmount = depositingAmount;
```
Also update `borrowing[user].depositDetails[borrowerIndex].borrowedAmount`
