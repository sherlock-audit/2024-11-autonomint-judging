# Unbounded Liquidation Iterations Can Lead to Withdrawal DoS

### Summary

The protocol's requiring users to iterate through all liquidation events since their deposit during withdrawal will cause eventual transaction failure for early depositors as the number of liquidations grows over time, preventing them from withdrawing their funds.


### Root Cause

In `CDSLib.withdrawUser()` at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L640 the forced iteration through all historical liquidations between deposit and withdrawal time creates potential for unbounded gas costs:

```solidity
// In CDSLib.withdrawUser:
if (params.cdsDepositDetails.optedLiquidation) {
    for (uint128 i = (liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1); i <= params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations; i++) {
        uint128 liquidationAmount = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
        if (liquidationAmount > 0) {
            CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationData = omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo[i];
            // Calculate share for each liquidation
            uint128 share = (liquidationAmount * 1e10) / uint128(liquidationData.availableLiquidationAmount);
            // Process liquidation share...
        }
    }
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Early user deposits with liquidation enabled (`liquidationIndexAtDeposit = currentLiquidations`)
2. Protocol operates normally over months/years
3. Many liquidations occur, incrementing `noOfLiquidations`
4. When early user attempts to withdraw:
   - Must process EVERY liquidation since their deposit
   - Gas costs grow linearly with number of liquidations
   - Eventually exceeds block gas limit

### Impact

Early CDS depositors who opted for liquidation will be unable to withdraw their funds once the number of liquidations grows too large, as their withdrawal transactions will exceed block gas limits
