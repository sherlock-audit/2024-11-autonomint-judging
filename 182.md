# Inaccurate interest rate accounting when updating `ratepersec` and `APR` in `borrowing.sol::setAPR`

### Summary

Updating ratepersec and APR in the `borrowing,sol::setAPR` function fails to account for the interest rate accrued at the previous rate and APR, leading to incorrect accounting for individuals borrowing positions and stepwise jumps.

### Root Cause

[issue is here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L515C3-L525C6) there is a global change in the ratepersec and APR by the admin and for all the borrowers.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin needs to call setAPR() to set ratepersec or APR to a new value.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This issue can result in inaccurate accounting for borrowers previous positions when ratepersec and APR are updated. in some cases borrowers may benefit from the reduced rate, and in some cases borrowers may be overcharged leading to financial losses.

### Mitigation

Implement a function that updates the previous interest rate and accounts for it before applying the new ratePerSec and APR values.
