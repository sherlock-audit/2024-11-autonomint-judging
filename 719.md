# Missing cds deposit amount in swapCollateralForUSDT

### Summary

swapCollateralForUSDT() will help to convert the remaining Ether to USDT. This part of upside collateral will be taken as the cds owner's profit. But we miss update the cds deposit amount. This will cause that cds owners fail to withdraw.

### Root Cause

In [Treasury.sol:804](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L804), when ether price increases and borrowers withdraw their collateral, there will be some remaining collateral because of the upside collateral. These remaining collateral will be taken as one part of the cds owner's profit and swapped to USDT.

This part of profit has already updated into the cds cumulative value(profit/loss), but we don't update the total cds deposit amount. This will cause that the total cds deposit amount will be less than cds owners should withdraw.

For example:
1. Alice deposits 1000 USDT/USDA into cds.
2. Bob borrows some USDA using 1 Ether.
3. Ether price increases, Bob repays his debt. There will be some remaining Ether(e.g. 0.01 Ether). We will swap 0.01 Ether to USDT. But the total cds deposit amount is 1000.
4. Alice withdraw her position, her expected return amount should be (1000 + 30(cumulative gain) + 50(option fee)). When we try to deduct from totalCdsDepositedAmount, (1000 - (1000 + 30)), this transaction will be reverted.
```solidity
    function swapCollateralForUSDT(
        IBorrowing.AssetName asset, // input token
        uint256 swapAmount, // input token amt
        bytes memory odosAssembledData
    ) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = odosRouterV2.call{value: asset == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH ? swapAmount : 0}(odosAssembledData);
}
```
```solidity
    function withdrawUserWhoNotOptedForLiq(
        CDSInterface.WithdrawUserParams memory params,
        CDSInterface.Interfaces memory interfaces,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmount,
        uint256 totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees
    ) public returns (CDSInterface.WithdrawResult memory) {
        totalCdsDepositedAmount -= params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount;
}
```
```solidity
        uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn(
            msg.sender,
            index,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
            excessProfitCumulativeValue
        ) - 1; //? subtracted extra 1 wei
        // here we change the depositedAmount.
        cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = currentValue;
        uint256 returnAmount = cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount + optionFees;
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 1000 USDT/USDA into cds.
2. Bob borrows some USDA using 1 Ether.
3. Ether price increases, Bob repays his debt. There will be some remaining Ether(e.g. 0.01 Ether). We will swap 0.01 Ether to USDT. But the total cds deposit amount is 1000.
4. Alice withdraw her position, her expected return amount should be (1000 + 30(cumulative gain) + 50(option fee)). When we try to deduct from totalCdsDepositedAmount, (1000 - (1000 + 30)), this transaction will be reverted.

### Impact

We miss updating the total cds deposit amount when there is some upside collateral. This may cause cds owners fail to withdraw their positions.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

After we swap collateral to USDT, we should mint the related USDA and add these to total cds deposit amount.
