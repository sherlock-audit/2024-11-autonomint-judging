# No slippage protection in `liquidationType2::synthetix:exchange()`

### Summary

The Liquidation type2 liquidates the position by taking short position in Synthetix.
It uses `synthetix.exchange` to exchange sETH with sUSD but there is no slippage protection mechanism to resist any value loss due to the exchange. 

### Root Cause

`BorrowingLiquidation::liquidationType2()` exchanges sETH with sUSD without any slippage protection.

```solidity
        // Exchange sETH with sUSD
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );
```
