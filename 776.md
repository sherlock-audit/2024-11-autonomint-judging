# CDS deposits' `lockingPeriod` is not enforced in CDS.withdraw(), allowing premature exits and creating unfair advantages

### Summary

The CDS system implements a lockingPeriod for deposits, but this period is not enforced during withdrawals. Only the protocol's default withdrawalTimeLimit is checked, allowing users to withdraw funds before their intended locking period ends. This creates an unfair advantage for users who can interact directly with the smart contract, bypassing any frontend restrictions.

### Root Cause

In [`CDS.sol:279`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L279-L433), there's a missing check for the deposit's chosen lockingPeriod, which makes the lockingPeriod bypassable if a user changes their mind and wants to withdraw ealier than they chose, which goes against how defi products should operate.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has deposited into CDS with a specified lockingPeriod
2. Default withdrawalTimeLimit has passed
3. Current time is still within the intended lockingPeriod

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User deposits into CDS with a long lockingPeriod

```solidity
cds.deposit{value: 10 ether}(365 days); // 1 year lock
```

2. Wait for withdrawalTimeLimit to pass (shorter than lockingPeriod)
```solidity
// withdrawalTimeLimit 15 days
skip(16 days);
```

3. Withdraw funds despite being within lockingPeriod
```solidity
cds.withdraw(); // Succeeds despite being locked for a year
```


### Impact

1. Security implications:
  - Undermines CDS system's stability
  - Makes lockingPeriod parameter meaningless
  - Creates inconsistent user expectations
2. Fairness issues:
  - Technical users can bypass locking via direct contract interaction
  - Frontend-only users might be restricted unfairly
  - Creates two-tiered system of access

### Mitigation

1. Implement lockingPeriod check in withdrawal:

```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    require(block.timestamp > lastWithdrawalTime + withdrawalTimeLimit, 
            "Time limit not passed");
    
    // Add locking period check
    require(block.timestamp > depositTime + lockingPeriod, 
            "Still in locking period");
            
    // Proceed with withdrawal
}
```
