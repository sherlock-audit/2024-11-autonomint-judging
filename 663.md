# Liquidation can be blocked if `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0`

### Summary

During liquidation, when the amount if `usda` to get to get from other chains is zero [(i.e `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0`)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L302-L305), the value of ETH that is suppose to be sent with cross chain transaction is wrongly returned to the borrower instead of the liquidator

```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
302:         if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
303:    @>       (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
304:             require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
305:         }

```

This can be weaponised by a malicious user to block liquidations

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Also, as described below, borrowers can weaponise this to block liquidation by reverting in their in their `receive()` function

- Alice borrows via a proxy contract and thereafter upgrades the implementation contract with one that reverts in the `receive()` function
- her position defaults
- protocol cron job calls liquidate and the `liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain` evaluates to zero
- liquidation reverts and position becomes unliquidateable

### Impact

- borrowers can block liquidation causing protocol to incur bad debt

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `borrowLiquidation::liquidationType1(...)` function as shown below

```diff
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
302:         if (liqAmountToGetFromOtherChain == 0) {
-303:            (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: msg.value}("");
+303:            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: msg.value}("");
304:             require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
305:         }
```
