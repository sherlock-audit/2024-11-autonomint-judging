# Looping over unbounded `omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo` can lead to permanent DoS and frozen funds

### Summary

In the `CDS::withdraw` flow, when the depositor withdrawing opted to have his funds user for liquidation, there is a risk of DoS due to a looping over unbounded `omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo`. The loop is index goes from the liquidation index at the moment of the deposit to the liquidation index to the moment of withdrawal. The greater the number of liquidations that occurred, the higher the last index will increase and the more the depositor will run the risk of not being able to withdraw his funds due to an OOG revert.

### Root Cause

In `CDSLib::withdrawUser` in order to calculate how much of each collateral asset will be paid to the user, the protocol loops over each liquidation data subsequent to the liquidation index in which the user deposited and calculates the corresponding share of the total liquidation earnings.

The issue is that the amount of subsequent liquidations is unbounded and the `CDSLib::withdrawUser` function will try to calculate the earning for every single subsequent liquidation index from user deposit. This means that users that left their deposit a large period of time (meaning that a large amount of liquidations happened), will get their withdraw of deposited assets and earnings DoSed in case they opted to deposit some liquidation available to cover liquidations:

```solidity
// Loop through the liquidations that were done after user enters
for (uint128 i = (liquidationIndexAtDeposit + 1); i <= params.omniChainData.noOfLiquidations; i++) {
    uint128 liquidationAmount = params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
    // If the user available liquidation is non zero
    if (liquidationAmount > 0) {
        CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationData = omniChainCDSLiqIndexToInfo[i];
        // Calculate the share by taking ratio between
        // User's available liquidation amount and total available liquidation amount
        uint128 share = (liquidationAmount * 1e10) / uint128(liquidationData.availableLiquidationAmount);
        // Update users available liquidation amount
        params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount -= getUserShare(liquidationData.liquidationAmount, share);
        // Based on the collateral type calculate the liquidated collateral to give to user
        if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH) {
            // increment eth amount
             params.ethAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
        } else if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH) {
            // increment weeth amount and weth amount value
            weETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
            weETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
        } else if (liquidationData.assetName == IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH) {
            // increment rseth amount and rseth amount value
            rsETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
            rsETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
        }
    }
}

### Internal pre-conditions

A `CDS` depositor who opted for have his asset used for liquidations accrued earnings to a large amount of liquidation indexes.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`CDS::withdraw` for `CDS` depositors who opted for liquidation in risk of DoS. 

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Let the user choose which indexes they want to withdraw. An extra mechanism has to be developed.
