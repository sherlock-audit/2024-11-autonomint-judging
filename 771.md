# User can put any arbitrary `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` while calling `CDS.sol::redeemUSDT` function.

### Summary

`CDS.sol::redeemUSDT` is used to swap usda for usdt, takes the amount to swap and price of usda/ usdt as parameters. but the redeemer can use any arbitrary value of `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice`, making the trade in his profit or drain out amount more than expected.

also the value of `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` isn't checked anywhere in `CDS.sol::redeemUSDT` and `CDSLib.sol::redeemUSDT` functions. 

### Root Cause

passing `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` as parameters.

### Attack Path

1. User will call `CDS.sol::redeemUSDT` passing `usdaPrice` very high (than actual marketPrice) and `usdtPrice` very low (than actual marketPrice).
2. In `CDSLib.sol::redeemUSDT` the calculation will be as follow -
```js
    uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
    interfaces.treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.TUSDT, address(interfaces.cds), usdtAmount);
    // Transfer usdt to user
    bool success = interfaces.usdt.transferFrom(
        address(interfaces.treasury),
        msg.sender,
        usdtAmount
    );
```
3. User will end up getting larger amount tha expected or if he very bad he can drain out all `usdt` from the treasory.

### Impact

1. User can take out funds more than expected.
2. USDT in treasory can be fully drained out.

### Mitigation

avoid passing `usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice` as parameters, even it's passed check it's legitimacy whether it's in market value or not.
