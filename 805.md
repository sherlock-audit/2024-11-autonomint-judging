### PoC

`Treasury::totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountLiquidatedInWei` refers to amount of collateral gathered from users[totalCollateralAvailableInETHValue] after liquidation and `Treasury::liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei` and when a CDS depositors want to withdraw their assets they get their share from liquidation amount but when CDS depositors get their shares `Treasury::totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountLiquidatedInWei` and `Treasury::liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei` wouldn't be updated and this causes another cds depositors cannot get their share because of stale amount for both values

let's assume liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei for weETH is 1 weETH and a a CDS depositorA share is 50% and depositorA withdraw his/her assets and get 0.5 weETH from liquidation amount and 0.5 weETH remain in treasury and after a while another chain need weETH and get 0.2 weETH from this chain hence 0.2 weETH remain in this chain and then CDS depositorB which her/his share is 50% want to withdraw his/her share and 1 weETH pass to `CDSLib::getLiquidatedCollateralToGive` as a liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei while just 0.2 weETH exists in treasury further more this issue also exist for ETH and rsETH

### Impact
Breaks core contract functionality

### Mitigation
consider to update `Treasury::totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountLiquidatedInWei` and `Treasury::liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei` for every asset in GlobalVariables and CDSLib
