# protocol will not be able to withdraw totalInterestFromLiquidation

### Summary

Underflow in `withdrawInterest` function will allow to withdraw Interest From Liquidation earned by protocol

### Root Cause

Protocol earns his part of revenue through totalInterestFromLiquidation and totalInterest as we can see from function below. But when protocol deicide to withdraw all his revenue by passing `amount=totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation`
there will be under in 
`totalInterest -= amount`
`totalInterest -= totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation`
which mean he will never be able to claim it
```solidity
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
        require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
        totalInterest -= amount;
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

protocol earn totalInterestFromLiquidation

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

None, always happens by itself

### Impact

protocol will lose revenue via totalInterestFromLiquidation

### PoC

not needed

### Mitigation

Remove totalInterestFromLiquidation from contract and update `totalInterest`
```diff
    function updateTotalInterestFromLiquidation(
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts {
-        totalInterestFromLiquidation += amount;
+        totalInterest += amount;
    }

```

```diff
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
-        require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
+        require(amount <= (totalInterest),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
        totalInterest -= amount;
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

```
