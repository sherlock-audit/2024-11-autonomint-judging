# Exploitable Inconsistency Between `strikePrice` and `strikePercent` in Deposit Logic

## Summary  
The `strikePrice` and `strikePercent` parameters in the [Borrowing::depositTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L226) function are essential for calculating option fees. However, there is no validation to ensure that these parameters are logically consistent with each other. As the `strikePercent` increases from 5% to 25%, the option fees decrease, but the potential for higher gains at withdrawal increases. This results in a situation where lower `strikePercent` values (e.g., 5%) have a higher likelihood of producing gains because the price of ETH is more likely to move by 5% than by 25%.

The absence of checks to validate the relationship between `strikePrice` and `strikePercent` exposes the system to exploitation. A malicious user can choose a high `strikePercent` (e.g., 25%) for reduced option fees while setting a lower `strikePrice` (e.g., 5%) to take advantage of the higher potential returns that would normally apply to a lower `strikePercent` scenario. This inconsistency poses a significant risk to the protocol's financial stability.

## Root Cause  
The core issue lies in the lack of validation between the `strikePrice` and `strikePercent` parameters, allowing mismatched values that can be exploited.

## Internal Preconditions  
None

## External Preconditions  
The collateral assetâ€™s value must increase by at least 5% from the deposited value by the time of withdrawal.

## Attack Path  
1. Exploit the lack of validation between `strikePrice` and `strikePercent` by choosing mismatched values.
2. Select a `strikePercent` of 25% (lower option fees) and a `strikePrice` set to `DepositingAmount + 5% of DepositingAmount` (lower `strikePrice`).
3. Due to the high `strikePercent`, the option fees paid will be minimal. At the same time, the improperly chosen `strikePrice` will result in the option fees being calculated as if the `strikePercent` were 5%, leading to higher-than-expected returns.  

For further reference, the [strike price gains calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L482) during withdrawal is handled here.

## Impact  
This issue allows users to bypass logical consistency checks by inputting arbitrary and inconsistent values for `strikePrice` and `strikePercent`. As a result, users can minimize their option fees while obtaining excessive gains intended for lower `strikePercent` values, ultimately causing financial harm to the protocol. Furthermore, the inconsistency also affects the [upsideToDeduct](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L259) calculation, resulting in a reduced amount being deducted as intended.

## POC  
N/A

## Mitigation  
To prevent this issue, proper validation of `strikePrice` against `strikePercent` should be implemented during the deposit process. An example validation could be as follows:
```solidity
    require(strikePrice == (depositingAmount + (strikePercent_value*depositingAmount/100)), "strikePrice and strikePercent are not matching");
```
