# Attacker can Deny Updates to Critical Variables

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the multisig contract where a critical function executeSetterFunction is not restricted to the CoreContracts. This allows any external party to invoke the function and manipulate the approval state. Specifically, attackers can front-run legitimate execution attempts by maliciously calling the executeSetterFunction to set all approvals to false before the changes are applied. This effectively denies service (DoS) to legitimate admin updates, disrupting the intended functionality and governance of the contract.

### Root Cause

The `executeSetterFunction` in the `multiSign.sol` contract lacks access restrictions, allowing any user to call it. Once the required number of multisig participants have voted on an upgrade, the approvals are set to `false` without reverting. This creates a vulnerability when contracts like `borrowing.sol` depend on the multisig for approval checks.

Specifically, `borrowing.sol` invokes the multisig to verify approvals before executing changes and subsequently resets approvals. The issue arises because approval variables are updated at the time of execution. An attacker can front-run the multisig function just as all required approvals are met, calling `executeSetterFunction` to cancel approvals. This prevents `borrowing.sol` from executing the change, causing a revert. As a result, the change would need to undergo the multisig approval process again, leaving it vulnerable to repeated denial of service (DoS) attacks.

For instance, in the `setLTV` function of `borrowing.sol`, if an attacker front-runs `executeSetterFunction` after approvals are met, the approvals would be reset to `false`. When `borrowing.sol` calls `executeSetterFunction`, it would revert, leaving no updates applied and necessitating another round of approvals, which could be continually disrupted.

### Relevant Code Snippets:

*From `multiSign.sol`:*

```solidity
    function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Get the number of approvals
        require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        // Loop through the approved functions with owners mapping and change to false
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
    }

```
From borrowing.sol:

```solidity
 function setLTV(uint8 ltv) external onlyAdmin {
        // Check ltv is non zero
        if (ltv == 0) revert Borrow_NeedsMoreThanZero();
        // Check whether, the function have required approvals from owners to set
        if (!multiSign.executeSetterFunction(IMultiSign.SetterFunctions(0))) revert Borrow_RequiredApprovalsNotMetToSet();
        LTV = ltv;
    }
   ```
 In this scenario, an attacker observing that the required approvals for `SetLTV` have been met could immediately call `executeSetterFunction` directly on the multisig contract, resetting the approvals. Consequently, when the `setLTV` function in `borrowing.sol` is called, it would fail the multisig approval check and revert, preventing the LTV update.

### Internal pre-conditions

Approvals must meet the minimum requirement for multisigApprovals.

### External pre-conditions

Approvals must meet the minimum requirement for multisigApprovals.


### Attack Path

 In this scenario, an attacker observing that the required approvals for `SetLTV` have been met could immediately call `executeSetterFunction` directly on the multisig contract, resetting the approvals. Consequently, when the `setLTV` function in `borrowing.sol` is called, it would fail the multisig approval check and revert, preventing the LTV update.

### Impact

Medium

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add restriction on which contract should be able to access `executeSetterFunction` in the multisig contract
