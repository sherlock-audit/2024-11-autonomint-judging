# Incorrect value used for option fee calculation during withdrawal

### Summary

In the CDS module, option fees are to reward CDS users for taking on the credit risk of borrowers defaulting their loans, as well as volatility risk, because of the fluctuating price of the collateral. Basically users are depositing `USDa` or `USDT` in the `CDS` contract, and they are essentially providing a hedge against these risks for the borrowers and in return CDS owners accrue option fees from the borrowers, which are calculated based on the collateral volatility and credit risk. However the formula used for calculating the fees is wrong, which will deflate or inflate the fees.

### Root Cause

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L343 - current value
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L442-L498 - `cdsAmountToReturn` function

The problem lies in the subtracted amount of the fee calculation formula: 

```javascript
CDS:

function withdraw(...) ... {
    ...
    // Calculate return amount includes eth Price difference gain or loss option fees
@>       uint256 optionFees = ((cdsDepositDetails.normalizedAmount * omniChainData.lastCumulativeRate) /
@>           (CDSLib.PRECISION * CDSLib.NORM_PRECISION)) - cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount;
        
        // Calculate the options fees to get from other chains
        uint256 optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain = getOptionsFeesProportions(optionFees);

        // Update user deposit data
        cdsDepositDetails.withdrawedTime = uint64(block.timestamp);
        cdsDepositDetails.ethPriceAtWithdraw = ethPrice;
@>      uint256 currentValue = cdsAmountToReturn(
            msg.sender,
            index,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValue,
            omniChainData.cumulativeValueSign,
            excessProfitCumulativeValue
        ) - 1; //? subtracted extra 1 wei

        cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount = currentValue;
        uint256 returnAmount = cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount + optionFees;
    ...
}
```

Here the initially deposited amount is subtracted, instead of the `currentValue`, which represents the cumulative gains or loses of ETH value to return to CDS owner. Note that the natspec of the option fees mentions: "Calculate return amount includes eth Price difference gain or loss option fees". Additionally the [docs](https://docs.autonomint.com/autonomint/autonomint-1/autonomint/dcds#accrual-of-option-fees-gains) confirm that option fees are calculated based on ETH's volatility. If the initial deposited amount is used, like in this case it will not account for fluctuations in ETH's value (i.e gains or loses). This can result in loses to protocol (because it will overpay more fees) or the user (because he can get less than it should) in volatile markets.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user should be a CDS owner, by providing USDa or USDT
2. There must be borrowers interacting with the protocol
3. After some time CDS owner should withdraw

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Breaks accounting, can incur loses to protocol or it's CDS module users.

### PoC
