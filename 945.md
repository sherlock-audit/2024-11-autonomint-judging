# Flawed Downside Protection Mechanism in `BorrowLib::withdraw`

### Summary

The protocol guarantees downside protection of up to 20% for all depositors at the time of withdrawal. However, the implementation in the `BorrowLib::withdraw` function has a critical flaw. While the `downsideProtected` amount is calculated based on the user's deposited amount and subtracted from the total debt in global state variables in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L840) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L873C15-L875C18), it is not actually deducted during the transfer process in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L877C15-L882C19).  As a result, the downside protection mechanism fails entirely, and users do not receive the promised protection against losses. This miscalculation also leads to inconsistencies in state variables and omnichain data, as the protocol incorrectly reflects the total debt repaid by borrowers.


### Root Cause

The `downsideProtected` amount is not properly subtracted during the repayment of debt to the treasury within the `BorrowLib::withdraw` function. This oversight renders the downside protection mechanism non-functional, preventing users from receiving the intended benefits.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The price of Eth value should be less than its value at the time of deposit Not more than 80%. To make user eligible for the downside protection. 

### Attack Path

1.When the Eth values falls upto 20% of its deposited value then `downsideProtected` amount is calculated correctly but is not deducted during the actual [transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L878C17-L882C19) process when repaying debt to the protocol.  
2. This leads to incorrect updates in state variables and omnichain data, as the protocol erroneously subtracts the `downsideProtected` amount from the total debt recorded in the global state but not during the actual debt repayment.

### Impact

- **Users do not receive downside protection**: Depositors are deprived of the promised downside protection, undermining the protocol's reliability and trust.  
- **Incorrect state updates**: The failure to properly deduct the `downsideProtected` amount causes discrepancies in global state variables and omnichain data, which can cascade into further issues for the protocol.
- **Losses to CDS users**: The incorrectly updated global variables and omnichain data related to the `downsideProtected` amount can lead to significant financial losses for CDS users.

### Mitigation

Subtract the `downsideProtected` during the transfer of debt to treasury. 
```solidity
bool transfer = interfaces.usda.transferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(interfaces.treasury),
                    (borrowerDebt - depositDetail.borrowedAmount) + discountedCollateral - downsideProtected; 
                );
```
