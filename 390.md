# MasterPriceOracle.sol returns the exchange rate in wrong decimals for non-ETH underlying tokens.

### Summary

MasterPriceOracle.sol on Optimisim returns the exchange rate in 8 decimals for non-ETH underlying tokens which leads to huge discrepancy in calculations.

### Root Cause

```_price``` function of the MasterPriceOracle.sol returns the price of the assets in 2 decimals and the exchange rate in 18 decimals. However, in the case of the assets being not ETH( WeETH,  WrsETH,  rsETH) on the Optimism chain the exchange rate is returned is the price value returned by the Chainlink feeds, which are in 8 decimals. The exchange rate of ETH is in 18 decimals and the rate for assets in Mode chain are also in 18 decimals.  
This leads to the exchange rate being severely undervalued(10e18 vs 10e8) and leads to funds loss for the users and the protocol.

One simple example is when the user deposits collateral( either of WeETH,  WrsETH,  rsETH) into the borrowing.sol by calling ```depositTokens``` function. Oracle contract is called to get the exchange rate of the collateral and the ETH price. Returned values are then used in BorrowLib.sol to calculate depositing amount adjusted with ETH value:

 ``` params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether;```

Since the exchange rate is in 8 decimals here, the adjusted ```params.depositingAmount``` will be in 8 decimals whereas it should be in 18.

### Internal pre-conditions

Contracts deployed on Optimism chain and the exchange rate of either of WeETH,  WrsETH,  rsETH is used in the calculations.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol and the users loose funds due to wrong decimal of the exchange rate.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the exchange rate of non-ETH assets in the MasterPriceOracle.sol to have 18 decimals.
