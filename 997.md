# Attacker can drain funds by passing incorrect price of USDa-USDT in `redeemUSDT` function

### Summary

In `redeemUSDT` function of CDS contract, usda price and usdt price are taken as input from the user and without validating the correctness of usda-usdt price, it transfers the usdt to user.

That means attacker can provide any price of usda and usdt to get more usdt from the contract which can leads to draining of protocol funds.

### Root Cause

There is no checks which make sure that provided prices of usdt and usda are true prices.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- Attacker will call redeemUSDT function of CDS contract with incorrect price of usda and usdt as parameter.
- redeemUSDT function calculate USDT value based on input provided by user which are incorrect.
- So that attacker can get high amount of USDT and can drain the protocol.

### Impact

Attacker can drain funds of the protocol by providing incorrect price of usda and usdt.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Protocol should not rely user input prices and use oracle prices.
