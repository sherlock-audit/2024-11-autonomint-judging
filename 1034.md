# Missing Validation on `withdraw` Function in `CDS.sol`

**Summary:**
The `withdraw` function in the `CDS.sol` contract lacks input validation for the `ethPrice` parameter. This allows users to manipulate the `ethPrice` used for calculating withdrawals, potentially leading to incorrect payouts or even loss of funds for the protocol.

**Root Cause:**
The `withdraw` function does not check if the provided `ethPrice` is within a reasonable range or matches a trusted oracle price.

**Affected Code:**
```solidity
function withdraw(...) external payable ... {
    ...
    // ethPrice passed as input, no validation
    (uint256 withdrawUSDa, uint128 withdrawETH) = CDSLib.withdraw(
        ...
        ethPrice
        ...
    );
    ...
}
```

**Attack Path:**
1. An attacker calls the `withdraw` function, providing a manipulated `ethPrice` value significantly lower than the actual market price.
2. The `withdraw` function uses this manipulated price to calculate the ETH withdrawal amount, resulting in a higher ETH payout than the user is entitled to.

**Impact:**
This vulnerability enables attackers to drain ETH from the CDS contract by providing artificially low `ethPrice` values during withdrawals. This could lead to significant financial losses for the protocol.

**Mitigation:**
Implement robust validation checks for the `ethPrice` parameter. Ensure that the provided price is within a reasonable range and matches a trusted oracle price feed.
