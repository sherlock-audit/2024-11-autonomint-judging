# Incorrect Address Used During ABond Token Minting

### Summary

When a user withdraws their collateral, they specify a `toAddress` parameter to indicate where the collateral should be sent. If the collateral is ETH, half of it is withdrawn as ETH and the remaining half is minted as ABond tokens. However, the code mistakenly uses `msg.sender` as the recipient of the minted ABond tokens instead of the user-specified `toAddress`.


### Root Cause

When users withdraw their collateral, they should specify the recipient address for the collateral tokens

```solidity
@>>     @param toAddress The address to whom to transfer collateral.
        @param index Index of the withdraw collateral position
        @param odosAssembledData odos assembled data got from odos api
        @param signature odos assembled data signed by backend from admin two address
        **/

    function withDraw(
@>>        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(1)) {
```

In the function `mintAbondToken` within the collateral withdrawal logic. Instead of passing the user-specified `toAddress` as the recipient for the minted ABond tokens, the code passes `msg.sender`, which causes the minted ABond tokens to be sent to the caller of the function rather than the intended recipient.


```solidity
                    // Mint the ABondTokens
                    depositDetail.aBondTokensAmount = mintAbondToken(
                        interfaces.abond,
                        params.bondRatio,
                        msg.sender,
                        params.index,
                        discountedCollateral
                    );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a withdrawal using a valid `toAddress` to transfer their collateral.
2. The withdrawal process mistakenly sends the minted ABond tokens to `msg.sender` instead of the `toAddress`.
3. This discrepancy can result in:
   - The ABond tokens being sent to an unintended recipient.
   - A potential loss of control over the tokens for the intended recipient (if `msg.sender` is a contract  don't implement withdrawal logic).


### Impact

If the `msg.sender` is a contract that doesn't implement a withdrawal function, aBond tokens minted for the user might be sent to that contract address and become stuck.

Impact: High (as user might face loss of collateral)
Likelihood: Low (If the `msg.sender` is a contract that doesn't implement a withdrawal function)
Severity: Medium

### Mitigation


Update the logic to correctly use the `toAddress` parameter when minting ABond tokens.


```solidity
            depositDetail.aBondTokensAmount = mintAbondToken(
                interfaces.abond,
                params.bondRatio,
                toAddress, // Correctly use 'toAddress' instead of 'msg.sender'
                params.index,
                discountedCollateral
            );
```
