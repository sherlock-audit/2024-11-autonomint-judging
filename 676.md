# Mismatch between liquidation and withdrawal allows withdrawal of unhealthy position

### Summary

Positions are due for liquidation when they the HealthFactor or `ratio` is <= 0.8 and can be liquidated by the admin. 



### Root Cause

However, due to an oversight in the [`BorrowLib::withdraw(...)` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L821-L822), a position at `ratio`  == 0.8 can be withdrawn successfully

```solidity
File: borrowLiquidation.sol
324:     function liquidationType2( //@audit MED: missing  omnichainData update (sponsor confirmed)
/////      ...........
333: 
334:         // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
335:         uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
336:   @>    require(ratio <= 8000, "You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");
337: 


File: BorrowLib.sol
803: 
804:     function withdraw(
805:         ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail,
806:         IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Params memory params,
807:         IBorrowing.Interfaces memory interfaces
808:     ) external returns (IBorrowing.BorrowWithdraw_Result memory) {
/////      ........
820: 
821:             // Check the health is grater thsn 0.8
822:   @>        if (borrowingHealth < 8000) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_BorrowHealthLow();

```

This means if the borrower of an unhealthy position calls `withdraw()` before the admin calls [liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L335-L336) on the position, it can be successfully withdrawn

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This breaks core protocol functionality allowing a path for users to withdraw from unhealthy position instead of restricting such positions for liquidation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

modify the `withdraw()` function as shown below

```diff
File: BorrowLib.sol
