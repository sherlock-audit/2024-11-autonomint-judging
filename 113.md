# withDraw() function has stricter requirements than deposit()

**Description:**
If EOA deposits ETH into the ```borrowing.sol``` contract then it would be impossible for the ETH to be withdrawn as there is stricter check in the ```borrowing.sol::withDraw()``` method than in the ```borrowing.sol::deposit()```.

[The additional ```isContract()``` check that is in withDraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L288)

**Recommended Mitigation:**
It is enough to check in the `deposit()` function, that way we will be sure there will be no contracts in `withDraw()`
