# Cds withdrawer can steal other user/delay submitting`excessProfitCumulativeValue` due to missing signing info

### Summary

[excessProfitCumulativeValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L285) is calculated based on the profit of the cds depositors that corresponds to the component below the strike price of all borrowers, and depends on the specific cds depositor withdrawing (cds depositors that deposited at different times will have different excessive cumulative profits).
Malicious users may fetch the `excessProfitCumulativeValue` meant for other users or eth prices and use themselves, as no signer/eth price information is sent.

### Root Cause

In `CDS:285`, the signature does not include key information such as the cds depositor or the eth price meant for this withdrawal.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User fetches legit `excessProfitCumulativeValue` from the backend.
2. Malicious user obtains this signature and uses it themselves, getting more profit by using the smaller `excessProfitCumulativeValue` signature.
3. Or, there is some delay and in the mean time the eth price changes, and the excessive profit is incorrect and the user withdrawss too much/little USDa, for the loss of other users of the protocol.

### Impact

Cds depositor withdraws too much/little USDa, which will not allow other cds depositors to get their full profit, as the profit was distributed between cds depositors. For example, if the excessive profit was calculated on a eth price of 5.5% increase, representing a profit of 0.5% above the strike price of 5%, but when the transaction settles the price is only at a 5% increase, the excessive profit should be 0 but will be 0.5%, taking the cds depositor the loss.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Consider calculating these values on chain as it can be difficult to manage offchain due to delays.
