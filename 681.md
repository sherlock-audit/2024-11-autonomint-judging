# Borrowers can avoid paying interest, due to incorrect interest rate updates

### Summary

When borrowers withdraw collateral from the borrowing.sol contract they have to pay interest on their debt. The issue is that the interest/cumulative rate is updated after the withdraw has been finalized. As a result, borrowers will pay less interest or may even completely avoid paying interest as the interest rate when repaying the debt is stale.

On the other hand, due to the same issue in the deposit function, users will be force to pay more interst than they should.

### Root Cause

In borrowing._withdraw the cumulative rate is updated after the withdraw has been finalized. This is an issue as the borrower's debt is calculated the following way:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L81
`(amount * cumulativeRate) / RATE_PRECISION`

As we can see the lower the cumulative rate, the lower the debt. Therefore, if the cumulative rate does not get updated before the withdrawal, the interest accrued between the `lastEventTime` and the time of the withdrawal will not be accumulated to the borrower's debt, allowing borrowerts to pay less interest than they should.

Furthermore, the same issue is also occuring in the deposit function, where depositors will have to pay higher interests as again the interest rate is updated after the deposit. As a result, the depositors will have to pay the interest accrued from the `lastEventTime` to the current time, even though they did not have any debt at that time.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User deposits at Timestamp 1, where the interest rate is 1e27.
2. At Timestamp 100 the user decides to repay the collateral.
3. However, the interest rate is yet to be updated and the `lastEventTime` is still at Timestamp 1.
4. As the interest rate is not updated before the withdrawal the user does not pay any interest, as the interest rate is still 1e27.

### Impact

Borrowers may escape paying interest or some depositors may be forced to pay higher interests than they should.

### Mitigation

Make sure to update the interest/cumulative rate before depositing/withdrawing instead of after.
