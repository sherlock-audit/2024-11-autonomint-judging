# The protocol must perform a write after an update for some global variables.

### Summary

The protocol must perform a write after an update for global variables.

For example, regarding borrow.sol::lastCumulativeRate,

t1 ---> t2 ----> t3 ----> t4

t1: anyone update lastCumulativeRate 
t2: a user call depositTokens
t3: anyone update lastCumulativeRate 
t4: a user call withdraw

in t2, it calculates normalizedAmount with t1's lastCumulativeRate.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L750
```solidity
uint256 normalizedAmount = calculateNormAmount(tokensToMint, libParams.lastCumulativeRate);
```

as the last step of depositToken, it updates lastCumulativeRate.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L257



in t4, it call `BorrowLib.withdraw` without the update
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowing.sol#L657

and it gets borrowerDebt with t3's lastCumulativeRate
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L825


As a result, we don't get interest of [t2, t5]; we got [t1, t3] one.

### Root Cause

In some codes, the protocol performs write before update.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Some calculations is performed incorrectly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do write after update if needed.
