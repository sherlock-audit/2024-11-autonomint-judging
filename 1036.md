# Interest from Liquidation can never be withdrawn

### Summary


Interest from Liquidation can never be withdrawn



### Root Cause


not subtracting withdraw amount from `totalInterestFromLiquidation` state


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path




Interest from Liquidation can never be withdrawn.
Example, totalInterest = 20, totalInterestFromLiquidation = 30
So, admin can withdraw 50 amount and the `require` validation passes, but next time will underflow revert due to 20 - 50.
so, admin will input only 20 as the amount and it will withdraw, and `totalInterest` now becomes 0.
But totalInterestFromLiquidation = 30 is still there and cannot be withdrawn.


[Treasury.withdrawInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L621-L622)

```solidity
    function withdrawInterest(
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        require(toAddress != address(0) && amount != 0,"Input address or amount is invalid");
    @>  require(amount <= (totalInterest + totalInterestFromLiquidation),"Treasury don't have enough interest");
    @>  totalInterest -= amount; 
        bool sent = usda.transfer(toAddress, amount);
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

```


### Impact


loss of USDa, `totalInterestFromLiquidation` cannot be removed. Lacking implementation of `totalInterestFromLiquidation` subtarction on `withdrawInterest`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation





use %, so 50% or 100% of amount from both can be withdrawn or use separate amount params for more custom flexibility
