# `OwnableUpgradeable` not inherited in `GlobalVariables` and `USDaStablecoin`

### Summary

Both `GlobalVariables` and `USDaStablecoin` contracts contain ownership logic (initializing the Ownable extension and using `onlyOwner`) but they do not inherit from `OwnableUpgradeable`, leading to potential issues with ownership and access control.

### Root Cause

- The `GlobalVariables` contract does not inherit from `OwnableUpgradeable`.
- The `USDaStablecoin` contract also does not inherit from `OwnableUpgradeable`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.  Due to the lack of inheritance from `OwnableUpgradeable`, the ownership-related functions and modifiers provided by `OwnableUpgradeable` will not be available in the `GlobalVariables` and `USDaStablecoin` contracts.
2.  This can lead to situations where there is no clear owner for these contracts, or where the intended access control mechanisms based on ownership are not enforced.

### Impact

- Impossible to use any access control in both `GlobalVariables` and `USDaStablecoin` contracts.

### PoC

We can easily see that even if the Ownable extension is being initialized in [`GlobalVariables.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L28C1-L33C20), the contract does not inherit from `OwnableUpgradeable`:

```solidity
contract GlobalVariables is
    IGlobalVariables,
    Initializable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OAppUpgradeable
{
    ...

    function initialize(
        address usdaAddress,
        address cdsAddress,
        address lzEndpoint,
        address delegate
    ) public initializer {
        // Assign usda of IUSDa type with usda address
        usda = IUSDa(usdaAddress);
        // Assign cds of CDSInterface type with cds address
        cds = CDSInterface(cdsAddress);
        // Initialize the owner in the contracts
        __Ownable_init(msg.sender); //@audit-issue ownable extension not inherited by the contract
        // Initialize the UUPS proxy
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        // Initialize the OAPP contract with endpoint and delegate addresses
        __OApp_init(lzEndpoint, delegate);
    }
}
```

And it's the same case for [`USDaStablecoin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/USDa.sol#L19C1-L24C29):

```solidity
contract USDaStablecoin is
    Initializable,
    OFTUpgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ERC20BurnableUpgradeable,
    ERC20PausableUpgradeable
    //@audit-issue did not inherit from OwnableUpgradeable
{
    ...

    function initialize(
        address _lzEndpoint,
        address _delegate
    ) public initializer {
        // Initialize the OFt
        __OFT_init("Autonomint USD", "USDa", _lzEndpoint, _delegate);
        // Initialize the token as burnable
        __ERC20Burnable_init();
        // Initialize the token as pausable
        __ERC20Pausable_init();
        // Initialize the owner of the contract
        __Ownable_init(msg.sender);
        // Initialize the proxy
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Inherit from `OwnableUpgradeable` in both `GlobalVariables` and `USDaStablecoin` contracts to ensure proper ownership and access control functionality.
