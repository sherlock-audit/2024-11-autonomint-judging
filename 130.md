# Incorrect `depositingAmount` calculation for non-18 decimal tokens in `BorrowLib.deposit`

### Summary

The `BorrowLib.deposit` function incorrectly assumes all tokens have 18 decimals by dividing `depositingAmount` by `1 ether`. Tokens such as USDT and USDA, which have 6 decimals, are mishandled, resulting in inaccurate deposit processing. This issue can lead to incorrect deposit calculations for non-18 decimal tokens.

### Root Cause

- The function uses `1 ether` for normalization in `params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / 1 ether`.

- Tokens with decimals other than 18 (e.g., USDT and USDA with 6 decimals) are incorrectly scaled, as their actual decimals are not considered.  
- There is no validation to ensure that only supported tokens with 18 decimals (e.g., ETH, WETH, WrSETH, rsETH) are processed.

### Impact

- **Incorrect Deposit Values**: Deposits for tokens with decimals other than 18 are calculated incorrectly, leading to overestimation or underestimation of the deposited amount.  
- **Potential Loss of Funds**: Users may lose value due to improper normalization.  
- **Systemic Risk**: Incorrect deposit scaling can disrupt system accounting and liquidity operations.

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint8 tokenDecimals = 18;
if (params.assetName != IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH)
    tokenDecimals  = IERC20(assetAddress[params.assetName]).decimals();
params.depositingAmount = (libParams.exchangeRate * params.depositingAmount) / (10 ** tokenDecimals);
```  
Alternatively, restrict deposits to only supported tokens with consistent decimals.
