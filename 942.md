# Submiting an offchain delayed offer will revert due to incorrect decimal calculations

### Summary

liquidationType2 takes 50% of a liquidated user's collateral and transfers it to Synthethix. To do that it first must convert the collateral into WETH and after that the WETH to sETH. After that the sETH is converted into sUSD and used to submit an offchain delayed order in Synthetix for short position with 1X leverage. The issue is that the `sizeDelta` parameter of the call to `submitOffchainDelayedOrder` is scaled incorrectly, causing the call to revert.

### Root Cause

In `liquidationType2` when a call is made to `submitOffchainDelayedOrder` the following value is passed for the `sizeDelta`/first parameter:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L362-L365
```solidity
        synthetixPerpsV2.submitOffchainDelayedOrder(
            -int((uint(margin * 1 ether * 1e16) / currentEthPrice)),
            currentEthPrice * 1e16
        );
```

As we an see the first parameter will have the following decimal precision:
-margin: 18 decimals
-1 ether: 18 decimals
-1e16: 16 decimals
-currentEthPrice: 2 decimals

Therefore, 18 + 18 + 16 - 2 = 50 decimal places. This is problematic as the decimals are too high and will cause the call to Synthetix to revert. The `sizeDelta` must instead be: 'sizeDelta: A wei value of the size in units of the asset being traded' per the Synthetix documentations, therefore, it should have 18 decimal places instead.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User gets liquidated through `liquidationType2`.
2. The call fails because the amount passed as the `sizeDelta` of `submitOffchainDelayedOrder` is significantly higher than it should be.

### Impact

Users will fail to be liquidated through `liquidationType2`.

### Mitigation

Make sure to use the appropriate decimal scaling when calling `submitOffchainDelayedOrder`.
