# Floored Logic Prevents Execution of `renewOptions` Function

### Summary

The logic in the `getOptionFeesToPay` function contains a flawed conditional check that prevents the `renewOptions` function from functioning as intended. Specifically, the condition if `(depositDetail.withdrawed && depositDetail.liquidated)` will always revert, making it impossible for the `renewOptions` function to execute successfully. This issue arises because there is already a check during the withdrawal process that prevents further execution if the position is liquidated.



### Root Cause

1. **Conditional Check in `getOptionFeesToPay`**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L441-L443
This condition will revert if both `withdrawed` and `liquidated` are true. However, the withdrawal process already includes a check that prevents the withdrawal of a liquidated position:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L814

2. **Contradiction:** Since a position cannot simultaneously have `withdrawed` and `liquidated` both set to true due to the withdrawal check, the condition in `getOptionFeesToPay` will always revert.

3. **Impact on `renewOptions`:** The `renewOptions` function depends on `getOptionFeesToPay`, but due to the always-reverting logic, `renewOptions` can never proceed to completion.

### Mitigation

```diff
-   if (depositDetail.withdrawed && depositDetail.liquidated)
-      revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyWithdrewOrLiquidated();
                
    
+   if (depositDetail.withdrawed || depositDetail.liquidated)
+      revert IBorrowing.Borrow_AlreadyWithdrewOrLiquidated();
