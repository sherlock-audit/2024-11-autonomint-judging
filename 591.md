# DoS in core functionality of the CDS contract due to `CDS::updateDownsideProtected` getting set to arbitrarily large value by a malicious user.

### Summary

The `updateDownsideProtected` function allows anyone to set an arbitrarily large value like `uint256.max` for the state variable `downsideProtected`, which can lead to permanent denial of service(DoS) for the CDS contract's deposit and withdraw functions.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of access control and input validation in the function [`updateDownsideProtected`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L829). It allows anyone to set any value for `downsideProtected` without any checks. (Now once the `downsideProtected` is set to uint256.max, then no one can reset it to 0 from the same function, as it always adds +=)

```solidity
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- A malicious user calls the function `updateDownsideProtected` function.
- Then malicious user sets downsideProtected to `uint256.max`. 
- Now after this any normal user won't be able to deposit or withdraw in CDS.  

### Impact

- It allows an attacker to permanently disable the core functionality of the CDS contract.
- The CDS contract becomes unusable for deposits and withdrawals, leading to loss of funds to Protocol, as no user will ever be able to provide USDa and USDT tokens from `CDS::deposit` and loss to CDS user who wants to `CDS::withdraw` but that will also DOS so they won't get their assets back, as they will be stucked. 

### PoC


A malicious user calls the function `updateDownsideProtected` function and sets downsideProtected to `uint256.max`.

```solidity
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```

Now, the next time any user who wants to [CDS::deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L186) at that time this line will be executed [_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L234) and will cause revert each and ever time it will be executed.

```solidity
    function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {

// @audit REVERT!    
          
@->         totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
            totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }
```

The reason why it will revert is because in this function `totalCdsDepositedAmount` represents the amount of total CDS deposit which is obviously going to be a realistic number that is going to be less than `downsideProtected` (which is already set to `uint256.max` by a malicious user) and therefore here underflow revert will happen.

So this is how the DoS will happen in `CDS::deposit`, and the same flow of DoS will also happen in `CDS::withdraw` over [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L324)    


### Mitigation

Add trusted access control check modifier to function `updateDownsideProtected`. So that no malicious user can set any values of `downsideProtected` to harm the protocol.
