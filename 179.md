# [H-1] Wrong check in `BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay` allows users to call `renewOptions` on expired Options and bypass fees

### Summary

When a new deposit is made via `Borrowing::depositToken` function, users pay upfront 30 days worth of `optionFees`. This is confirmed by the natspec above the function that says "The user will get LTV of the deposited collateral value with options fees deducted for a month".

According to the protocol's intent, users should only be able to renew their Options if the current `block.timestamp` falls between 15 to 30 days from the last renewal. This is normally done via the `Borrowing::renewOptions` function. The system is designed to make sure that users will always accrue at least 15 days worth of `optionFees` from the previous renewal and the users can renew their deposit for 30 more days, provided that they call the `renewOptions` function between 15-30 days from the most recent renewal.

Inside `BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L446) the check that should enforce this behavior is this one

```javascript
    function getOptionFeesToPay(ITreasury treasury, uint64 index) public view returns (uint256) {
//..
//..
            // check the user is eligible to renew position
            if (
                block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
                block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
//..
//..
```
However, the above check is flawed and it will never be true. The if statement should contain an `||` instead of an `&&`. In the current format the function checks if a value `X < t0 + 15 days` and at the same time `X > t0+ 30 days`. This will never be true because these 2 conditions will never be true at the same time. If `x < 15 = true` then `X > 30 = false` so the `if` statement is false, conversely if `x > 30 = true` then `x < 15 = false` so the `if` statement is false, and the last option is if `x = 20 for example`, then `x < 15 = false`  and `x > 30 = false` so the `if` statement will be false again.

Because of this, users can call the `Borrowing::renewOptions` function for an Option that should've been expired, in order to renew it. Based on how market prices are moving, this creates a context for users in which it may be more advantageous for them to renew an expired Option instead of creating a new Option as this will enable them to pay fewer fees, leading to loss of funds for the protocol.

### Root Cause

Wrong check inside `BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay`

```javascript
            //@audit incorrect logic that will never be true
            if (
                block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
                block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Fees are linear and they are calculated based on time elapsed since last renewal `depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp`. This can be checked inside the `BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay` function. 

### External pre-conditions

Let's assume that the asset being deposited is ETH. As we know the price of ETH moves every day.

### Attack Path

Key Idea:
Fees are linear with time and **scale with the current asset price**. If the asset price increases, starting a new coverage period at the higher price may results in higher per-day fees. By sticking to the old coverage (which uses the original price as a baseline), even paying for extra days (like 40 instead of 30) can be cheaper in total than paying for a fresh 30-day coverage at the new, higher price. I say 30-day coverage because upon depositing the protocol automatically deducts 30 days worth of fees.

**Initial Conditions (t0)**
- ETH price at t0: $2,000 per ETH
- Option coverage and fees: let’s say the fee for 30 days of coverage at $2,000/ETH is $300 total.
- Daily fee rate at t0: $300 / 30 days = $10/day.

User action at t0
The user deposits collateral, buys the initial coverage, and pays $300 upfront for these 30 days.

**Fast Forward to t1 (After 40 Days)**
Time elapsed: 40 days since initial coverage began.
ETH Price at t1: $3,000 per ETH (50% higher than at t0).
If the user’s coverage expired on day 30, and now on day 40 they want to secure coverage again, they have two choices:

Start fresh coverage at the new price:
Since ETH price is now $3,000 (50% higher than $2,000), the fees for a new 30-day coverage would scale similarly.

Original daily fee was $10/day at $2,000/ETH. With the price at $3,000/ETH, that’s a 50% increase. Since fees scale linearly with the price, because the asset's price is part of how `optionFees` are [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L674) during deposits, the new daily rate would be $15/day.

New 30-Day Coverage Cost at t1:
$15/day * 30 days = $450 total.
So, if the user starts anew at t1, they pay $450 for the next 30 days.


**Option #2 (which shouldn't be possible)**
Renew the Old Coverage for 40 Days at the Old Rate. 

Instead of starting a new coverage at a higher price, what if the user just continues with the old coverage which is enabled by the flawed logic. The old coverage is still effectively priced at the original rate ($10/day), because it's calculated from the initial conditions at t0. When calling `renewOptions` the price used to calculate the new fees is the one from the previous deposit/ last renewal as can be seen on this line of code `uint128 optionsFeesPerSec = calculateOptionsFeesPerSec(depositDetail.optionFees);` inside the `BorrowLib::getOptionFeesToPay` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L457).

If They Pay for 40 Days (instead of 30) at the Old Rate

- Daily rate = $10/day (from the original $2,000/ETH baseline)
- For 40 days: $10/day * 40 days = $400 total.

By renewing the old option late (at day 40), they pay $400 instead of $450. Even though they are paying for more days (40 instead of 30), they benefit from the old, cheaper per-day fee rate, which was locked in at the lower ETH price of $2,000 rather than the new $3,000 price.

**Comparison**
- Start fresh at new price (30 days at $3,000/ETH): $450
- Continue old coverage (40 days at $2,000/ETH equivalent rate): $400

The user saves 50$ by sticking to the old coverage and paying for more days at the old price rate than by starting a fresh 30 day coverage at the new, higher ETH price, leading to 50$ loss for the protocol.

### Impact

This can lead to loss of funds for the protocol in two ways.
- Potential loss of funds for the protocol due to users paying fewer fees.
- Loss of funds for the protocol because whenever `renewOptions` is triggered a new `downsideProtection` is also provided to the users. This `downsideProtection` is paid by the protocol to the user as well.
- Another impact is that users can renew expired Options, which means that Options NEVER expire, and this breaks a core invariant/assumption about Options trading in general. Options must have a deadline when they expire, it's in the nature of this financial instrument.


### PoC

Not needed.

### Mitigation

```diff
            if (
-               block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
+               block.timestamp < depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days ||
                block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
