# Incorrect wrapped amount of `rsETH` in `CDSLib::withdrawUser` leads to DoS of withdrawals in `CDS` and funds stuck

### Summary

When `CDSLib::withdrawUser` is called, and user opted for liquidation, when `rsETH` is going to be paid to the user, it needs to be wrapped in the treasury so it can be sent as an `ERC20` token. However, the wrapping only occurs if some amount has to be sent in the other chain, and the amount wrapped is the amount sent in the other chain, not the amount of the chain where it needs to be transferred. This causes a DoS in `CDS::withdraw` for all the users who opted for liquidation, and all the funds earned by liquidation (type 1, which is covered by `CDS` depositors) will be permanently stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

When the `CDS::withdraw` function is called by a `CDS` depositor who opted to have his asset used for liquidation, in the `CDSLib::withdrawUser` function it is calculated how much `rsETH` the depositor will receive:
[CDSLib.sol#L658-L660](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L658-L660)
```solidity
// increment rseth amount and rseth amount value
rsETHAmount += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmount, share);
rsETHAmountInETHValue += getUserShare(liquidationData.collateralAmountInETHValue, share);
```
Then:
[CDSLib.sol#L676-L694](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L676-L694)
```solidity
(
    totalWithdrawCollateralAmountInETH,
    params.ethAmount,
    weETHAmount,
    rsETHAmount,
    collateralToGetFromOtherChain
) = getLiquidatedCollateralToGive(
    CDSInterface.GetLiquidatedCollateralToGiveParam(
        params.ethAmount,
        weETHAmount,
        rsETHAmount,
        interfaces.treasury.liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei(IBorrowing.AssetName.ETH),
        interfaces.treasury.liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei(IBorrowing.AssetName.WeETH),
        interfaces.treasury.liquidatedCollateralAmountInWei(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH),
        interfaces.treasury.totalVolumeOfBorrowersAmountLiquidatedInWei(),
        params.weETH_ExchangeRate,
        params.rsETH_ExchangeRate
    )
);
```

Then, all those amounts of the different assets are sent to the user who is withdrawing. In this issue, what matters is that although one of the earned assets is `rsETH`, the one that is being sent to the user is its wrapped version `WreETH`:
[CDSLib.sol#L842-L851](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L842-L851)
```solidity
if (rsETHAmount != 0) {
    interfaces.treasury.approveTokens(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH, address(interfaces.cds), rsETHAmount);
    bool sent = IERC20(interfaces.borrowing.assetAddress(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH)).transferFrom(
            address(interfaces.treasury),
            msg.sender,
            rsETHAmount
        ); // transfer amount to msg.sender
    if (!sent) revert CDSInterface.CDS_TransferFailed(IBorrowing.AssetName.WrsETH);
}}
```

For this `WrsETH` transfer to succeed, first the `rsETHAmount` of `rsETH` has to be wrapped in `WrsETH`. However, that wrapping does not occur properly. The section of the code that does the wrapping is incorrect as it only wraps if there is collateral to be sent from the other chain, and it only wraps the amount needed from the other chain, not the amount that is going to be sent: `rsETHAmount`:
[CDSLib.sol#L740-L799](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L740-L799)
```solidity
if (
    params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain > 0 ||
    collateralToGetFromOtherChain > 0
) {
	...
    if (rsETHAmountFromOtherChain > 0) {
        interfaces.treasury.wrapRsETH(rsETHAmountFromOtherChain);
    }
}
```

This incorrect wrapping causes the `CDS::withdraw` function to revert in cases that `rsETHAmountFromOtherChain > rsETHAmount`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Liquidation type one occurs and `rsETH` is earned for the `CDS` depositors who opted for liquidation earnings.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

DoS of withdrawals for depositors who opted for liquidation in `CDS` and funds from liquidation earnings stuck.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Wrap the whole amount of `rsETH` that is going to be sent:
