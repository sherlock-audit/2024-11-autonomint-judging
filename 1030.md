# Hardcoded Pyth Price Update Fee Prevents Synthetix Short Position Liquidations

### Summary

When performing Type 2 liquidations via Synthetix short positions, the protocol uses a hardcoded fee of `1 wei` for Pyth price updates. This can cause liquidation orders to fail execution since Pyth requires dynamic fees based on network conditions.

### Root Cause

The issue occurs in the `executeOrdersInSynthetix` function which is called to execute delayed orders created during Type 2 liquidations:
[borrowLiquidation.sol#L381-L386](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L381-L386)
```js
function executeOrdersInSynthetix(
    bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData
) external onlyBorrowingContract {
    synthetixPerpsV2.executeOffchainDelayedOrder{value: 1}(address(this), priceUpdateData);
}
```
It executes the submitted order in Synthetix by calling `executeOffchainDelayedOrder`. The `executeOffchainDelayedOrder` function in synthetix requires ETH payment for Pyth price updates. The current implementation hardcodes `1 wei ({value: 1})` as the fee amount. Pyth price updates require dynamic fees based on network conditions and number of price updates. If Pyth requires more than 1 wei for the price update, the transaction will revert.

This is the [executeOffchainDelayedOrder](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/de2b994cc8064301288e7619042287cddb7c6753/contracts/PerpsV2MarketDelayedExecution.sol#L105-L134) function in Synthetix contracts:

```js
function executeOffchainDelayedOrder(address account, bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData) external payable onlyProxy {
        // important!: order of the account, not the sender!
        DelayedOrder memory order = marketState.delayedOrders(account);
        // check that a previous order exists
        require(order.sizeDelta != 0, "no previous order");

        require(order.isOffchain, "use onchain method");

        // update price feed (this is payable)
@>       _perpsV2ExchangeRate().updatePythPrice.value(msg.value)(messageSender, priceUpdateData);

        // more code
```
It is calling `updatePythPrice` with the `msg.value` which is `1 wei` in our case.

According to [Pyth Docs](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/updatePriceFeeds), the required fee for a given set of updates should be computed by passing them to `getUpdateFee`.

If the required fee for the given set of updates exceeds hardcoded `1 wei`, `updatePythPrice` will revert with the following error:

> InsufficientFee: The fee provided is less than the required fee. Try calling `getUpdateFee` to get the required fee.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A position is eligible for Type 2 liquidation
2. liquidationType2 has successfully:
  - Exchanged sETH for sUSD
  - Transferred margin = (amount * currentEthPrice) / 100 to Synthetix
  - Submitted delayed order for short position with 1x leverage


### External pre-conditions

1. Pyth price feed is operational
2. Synthetix perps market is active
3. Network conditions affect Pyth's required fee

### Attack Path

1. Position becomes eligible for Type 2 liquidation 
2. `liquidationType2` executes successfully:
   - Converts collateral to sUSD through multiple steps
   - Transfers margin to Synthetix
   - Submits delayed order for short position
3. `executeOrdersInSynthetix` is called to execute the pending order
4. Function sends hardcoded 1 wei fee for Pyth price update
5. If Pyth requires higher fee:
    - Price update fails
    - Order execution reverts
    - Short position is not established
    - Liquidation is incomplete   

### Impact

Type 2 liquidations get stuck after significant state changes

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Query required fee from Pyth before execution using `getUpdateFee` from pyth:
```js
function executeOrdersInSynthetix(
    bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData
) external onlyBorrowingContract {
    uint256 requiredFee = pyth.getUpdateFee(priceUpdateData);
    synthetixPerpsV2.executeOffchainDelayedOrder{value: requiredFee}(
        address(this), 
        priceUpdateData
    );
}
```
