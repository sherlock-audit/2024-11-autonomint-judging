# Incorrect option fees accounting

### Summary

When withdrawing from CDS `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` is incorrectly updated. As a result, it is highly possible for the issue to prevent users from withdrawing their assets from CDS.

### Root Cause

In CDSLib.withdrawUser:731 `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` is deducted by
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L731
```solidity
(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount + params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain)
```

The issue is that it should be deducted by
```solidity
(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount + (params.optionFees - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain))
```

as the option fees from the other chain should not be deducted from the deposited amount on the current chain.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. When users withdraw from CDS if the option fees on the other chain are higher than the option fees on the current chain `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` will be decremented by the higher option fees.
2. This will gradually decrease its value until it becomes insufficient to handle a user's withdrawal, causing the function to revert with an underflow.

### Impact

Users will be unable to withdraw theit CDS deposits.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Decrease `totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees` by 

```solidity
(params.cdsDepositDetails.depositedAmount - params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount + (params.optionFees - params.optionsFeesToGetFromOtherChain))
```
