# Lack of access control in `updateDownsideProtected` function leads to malicious things

### Summary

`updateDownsideProtected` function of CDS contract can be called by anyone.

```solidity
    function updateDownsideProtected(uint128 downsideProtectedAmount) external {
        downsideProtected += downsideProtectedAmount;
    }
```
This function update the `downsideProtected` state variable that means anyone can call this function and update `downsideProtected` variable to malicious value.

In this function `downsideProtected` is always increasing that means it cannot be downgraded than current value. So if attacker call this function and set it as max value of uint256 then it cannot be reset again.

That means CDS contract's main functionalities like deposit and withdraw will not work and DoSed forever because it calls `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` function which will revert due to below line :

```solidity
function _updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount() private {
        if (downsideProtected > 0) {
@>          totalCdsDepositedAmount -= downsideProtected;
@>          totalCdsDepositedAmountWithOptionFees -= downsideProtected;
            downsideProtected = 0;
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
