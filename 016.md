# strikeprice doesn't align with strikePercent

### Summary

Users can purchase options at a lower cost because the strike price is not restricted.

### Root Cause

User can set strike price to any value, there is no validation for input params. It is not tied to strikePrecent which it should as well
 ```solidity
         // Update the borrower details for this index
        depositDetail.normalizedAmount = uint128(normalizedAmount);
        depositDetail.strikePrice = params.strikePrice * uint128(params.depositingAmount);
 ```

if user set strike price to lower than current eth price than his funds will be stuck due to this line

### Internal pre-conditions



### External pre-conditions



### Attack Path
set percent to max value - TWENTY_FIVE, but strike price to current eth that is appropriate for five percent

### Impact

since strikePrice is not tied to strike percent users will be able to buy options for less than suppose to and protocol will receive less funds


### Mitigation

Align strike price and Percentage in `calculateOptionPrice`
