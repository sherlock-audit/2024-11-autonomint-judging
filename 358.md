# `CDS::redeemUSDT` is vulnerable to input price manipulation attack, leading attacker to drain USDT from treasury.

### Summary
The redeemUSDT function in the CDS contract is vulnerable to price manipulation attacks. Users can exploit this vulnerability to drain USDT from the treasury contract by manipulating the input prices for USDa and USDT.

Note: Both the tokens USDa and USDT are stable coin and are peg with $1. But here, the manipulation of these tokens prices can be done by attacker.
 
### Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of user-provided price inputs (`usdaPrice` and `usdtPrice`) in the exchange rate calculation, without any validation or use of a trusted price oracle. And on top of that, there is not a single check in the whole flow to check whether the user input prices are correct according to the actual current market or not.

Flow: [CDS::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506) --> [CDSLib::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L382)

```solidity
    function redeemUSDT(
          uint128 usdaAmount,
@>        uint64 usdaPrice,
@>        uint64 usdtPrice
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused(IMultiSign.Functions(6)) {
        
@->         burnedUSDaInRedeem = CDSLib.redeemUSDT(
            Interfaces(
                treasury,
                globalVariables,
                usda,
                usdt,
                borrowing,
                CDSInterface(address(this))
            ),
            burnedUSDaInRedeem,
            usdaAmount,
            usdaPrice,
            usdtPrice
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions
This function is external, so it can be called by anyone, without any restrictions

### External pre-conditions
A Attacker should have some USDa tokens, in order to execute this attack. See the example in PoC.

### Attack Path
- A malicious user calls the redeemUSDT function.
- The user provides manipulated values for usdaPrice and usdtPrice. 
- The function calculates the exchange rate using these manipulated values.
- The user receives an unfairly large amount of USDT in exchange for their small USDa.
- The attacker can repeat this process to drain the USDT from the treasury contract.

### Impact
The attacker will drain USDT from the treasury contract, causing a huge loss of protocol and its trusted users.

### PoC

Example and Impact -> 
- calculate the USDT:USDa amount formula in [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L404) ->

```solidity
uint128 usdtAmount = ((usdaPrice * usdaAmount) / usdtPrice);
```

Calculation of the above formula with actual numbers, where the attacker is doing manipulation in input param of [CDS::redeemUSDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L506)  ->
- usdaAmount = 100e6 , usdaPrice = 100e6 , usdtPrice = 1e6
- manipulated calculations -> (100e6 * 100e6) / 1e6 =  10000e6

- so here attacker gave (burned) his 100 USDa tokens only and in return, he got back 10000 USDT from the [treasury](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L408), whereas in reality he was supposed to get 100e6 USDT tokens only because as we know USDa and USDT are stablecoin peg to $1. The attacker can do this operation multiple times and drain all USDT from the treasury contract

### Mitigation
Use a trusted price oracle (like Chainlink) to fetch the current USDa/USDT price, instead of relying on arbitrary user input.
