# odosAssembledData that is used in `withDraw()` is not compliant with EIP-712

### Summary

In the readme, it is said that the only standard the protocol is to be compliant is EIP-712.

"Read me from contest's page in Sherlock:
Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?

We have used EIP-712 for verifying sign"

It uses classic signature and `odosAssembledData`, the former uses a nonce in it, which is correct in regards to the compliance with EIP-712, but the latter doesn't use nonce as seen in the code, which is contrary to EIP-712

### Root Cause

Incompliance with EIP-712 with the second type of signature that's `odosAssembledData` in regards to a lack of nonce which is a crucial part of signatures that prevents replays.

Nonce is present in [normal signatures](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L887-L896), but not for `odosAssembledData` [as seen here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/CDS.sol#L898-L906)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `borrowing::withDraw()` passing `odosAssembledData` to be compared against a signature

### Impact

Protocol is not fully compliant with EIP-712 due to a lack of nonce in `odosAssembledData`, which is a crucial concept in the EIP-712 standard.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a nonce when verifying signature with `odosAssembledData`
