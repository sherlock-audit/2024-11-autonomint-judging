# Incorrect `State` Update for `from` Address in `transferFrom`

### Summary

In The [`Abond::transferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Token/Abond_Token.sol#L147)
function, the state of the `from` address is incorrectly updated after debiting tokens. Instead of updating the `from` address in the `userStates` mapping, the function updates the state for `msg.sender.` This results in incorrect accounting of balances and states for the from address, leading to double counting and financial loss for the protocol.

### Root Cause

The `Colors._debit` function correctly calculates the updated state for the from address:
```javascript
fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
```
However, the updated `fromState` is mistakenly assigned to `userStates[msg.sender]` instead of `userStates[from]:`
```javascript
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState; // Incorrect
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `from` address retains its original state, leading to an inflated balance.
The `msg.sender` state is incorrectly updated, this can either increase the `msg.sender` if he never had any tokens or decrease his state values.
In all cases, since `abond` can be used to redeem `ETH` in the `borrowing` contract, this leads to financial loss for the protocol.

### PoC

1. A legitimate transfer is initiated using transferFrom:
```javascript
transferFrom(fromAddress, toAddress, value);
```
2. The function debits the `fromState:`
```javascript
fromState = Colors._debit(fromState, uint128(value));
```
3. The function mistakenly updates `userStates[msg.sender]` instead of `userStates[from]:`
```javascript
userStates[msg.sender] = fromState; // Incorrect
```


### Mitigation

Ensure the `fromState` is assigned to `userStates[from]:`
```javascript
userStates[from] = fromState;
```
