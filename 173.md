# No slippage protection when exchanging with synthethix

### Summary
The lack of slippage protection when exchanging assets on Synthetix can result in bricking the liquidation process for a borrower.

### Root Cause
 
As it can be seen from the [synthetix repo](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/de2b994cc8064301288e7619042287cddb7c6753/contracts/BaseSynthetix.sol#L203-L219) and from the interface we have in [autonomint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/borrowLiquidation.sol#L23-L29): 

When calling `exchange()` in `liquidationType2` when doing liquidation in `borrowingLiquidations.sol`
```solidity
   synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );
```

we are supposed to get back the amount received:
```solidity
interface ISynthetix {
    function exchange(
        bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey,
        uint sourceAmount,
        bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey
@>> ) external returns (uint amountReceived);
}
```
as with every dex, its almost certain `amountReceived != amount`, it could be a very little difference, but it would be a difference, which is enough to break next parts of our code:

```solidity
        // Exchange sETH with sUSD
        synthetix.exchange(
            0x7345544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
            amount,
            0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        );

        // Calculate the margin
@>>     int256 margin = int256((amount * currentEthPrice) / 100);
        // Transfer the margin to synthetix
@>>     synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin);
```
After exchanging the `sETH` and receiving `sUSD`, the amount of margin to be transferred to `synthetixPerpsV2` is calculated based on the exact `amount of ETH` exchanged. However, if slightly less `sUSD` is received due to slippage, there won't be enough margin, and the transaction will revert when calling `synthetixPerpsV2.transferMargin(margin)`.

### Internal Preconditions

_No response_

### External Preconditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
- `LiquidationType2` is supposed to be called by an admin.
- The admin is unable to call it because the transaction reverts due to the absence of slippage tolerance in the current logic.
- This results in bricking the liquidation process and causing a denial of service (DoS) for the transaction.

### Impact
- Liquidations must be consistently available. The current logic could cause a DoS, making `LiquidationType2` unavailable.

### Mitigation
Use the returned `amountReceived` and apply slippage protection with a small deviation, such as 0â€“0.5%.
