# Anyone can steal USDT from the protocol using the redeemUSDT function.

### Summary

```redeemUSDT``` can be called by anyone using the arbitrary price for USDA and USDT as an input, which are not validated by a 3rd party, to steal USDT from the treasury. 

### Root Cause

```redeemUSDT ``` function in CDS.sol is an external function that can be called by anyone to exchange USDA for USDT. The prices of the assets are given by the user as an input for the function call, and the prices are not verified using an oracle. 
A malicious user can call the function with the price of USDA as 1000 and USDT as 1 and exchange his 1 USDA for 1000 USDT. This example is a small number for simplicity but it can be used to drain all the USDT from the treasury with a minimal amount of USDA.
