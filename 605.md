# Risk of Option Fee Evasion Due to Unchecked Volatility Parameter in DepositTokens

### Summary

The absence of adequate validation for the ``ethVolatility`` parameter in the ``depositTokens`` function within borrowing.sol creates an opportunity for malicious actors to manipulate the option fee calculation. This vulnerability allows users to adjust volatility values in a way that minimizes or potentially eliminates the fees associated with depositing, leading to unintended financial losses.

### Root Cause

In the ``depositTokens`` function, the parameter ``ethVolatility`` is included in the ``depositParams`` struct, which is passed to the ``BorrowLib.deposit`` function. However, the volatility field is not properly validated before being used. Specifically, the value of ``ethVolatility``, derived from off-chain sources, is then employed in the ``calculateOptionPrice`` function to determine the option fees. Without validation or bounds checking, an attacker can provide a manipulated volatility value to reduce the calculated option fees, or even cause them to round down to zero due to Solidityâ€™s handling of precision in calculations.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows malicious users to exploit the system by altering the ``ethVolatility`` parameter in order to minimize or eliminate the fees they are required to pay when renewing options. The lack of validation compromises the integrity of the option fee structure, resulting in financial losses for the protocol.

### PoC

An attacker could manipulate the volatility parameter during the deposit process, choosing a value that results in an abnormally low or zero option fee. This manipulation would effectively bypass the fee mechanism, leading to significant losses for the protocol. Additionally, this could be used to exploit the rounding behavior in Solidity, which may round the option fee to zero if the manipulated volatility is small enough.

            _options,
            msg.sender

    }
```

### Mitigation

Implement proper validation for the ``ethVolatility`` parameter in the ``depositTokens`` function to ensure that only legitimate values are used in the option fee calculations.
