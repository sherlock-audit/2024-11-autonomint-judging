# Unrestricted Access to `executeSetterFunction` Allows Unauthorized Approval Reset

### Summary

The `executeSetterFunction` function lacks access control, allowing any address to call it and reset the approvals made by owners for setter functions. This can disrupt the approval process and potentially lead to denial of service by requiring owners to redo their approvals.

### Root Cause

The `executeSetterFunction` function is missing the `onlyOwners` modifier, meaning it can be called by anyone. Unauthorized users can reset the approvals for setter functions, interfering with the normal operation of the multi-signature approval mechanism.

```solidity
function executeSetterFunction(
    SetterFunctions _function
) external returns (bool) {
    require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals, "Required approvals not met");
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

An attacker can call this function and reset the approvals:

1. Wait for owners to approve a setter function.
2. Before the owners execute the function, the attacker calls `executeSetterFunction` with the same `_function` parameter.
3. The approvals are reset, and the owners must approve the function again.

### Impact

Denial of service by requiring owners to redo their approvals

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict access to `executeSetterFunction` by adding the `onlyOwners` modifier:

```solidity
function executeSetterFunction(
    SetterFunctions _function
) external onlyOwners returns (bool) {
    require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals, "Required approvals not met");
    for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
        approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
