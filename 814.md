# Missing downside protection as the borrower always has to pay the full USDa amount

### Summary

In [BorrowLib::withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L804), the borrower always has to pay the full debt amount, when it should have access to downside protection in case of price drop.

### Root Cause

In `BorrowLib:867`, it is missing subtracting `downsideProtected`, so the borrower always has to pay the full amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Cds depositors deposit USDa.
2. Borrower deposits collateral and borrows USDa.
3. ETH price drops, but borrower still has to pay all the USDa. In addition to this, USDa equal to the downside protection is burned from the treasury.

### Impact

Borrower takes the loss by paying for the downside protection.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Subtract the downside protection from the amount to burn as it will be burned from the treasury.
