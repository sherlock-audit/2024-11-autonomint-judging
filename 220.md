# Treasury::withdraw will always revert since require statement is inverted

### Summary

The `Treasury::withdraw` has a check to see if a deposit has been withdrawn, however the require statement is inverted. The check incorrectly requires `depositDetails.withdrawed` to be true instead of false. Since the user has not withdrawn the deposit, the transaction will revert in "Already withdrawn".

[Inverted require statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L239)

### Root Cause

The require statement is inverted, so instead of checking if a deposit has not been withdrawn, it checks if a deposit has been withdrawn.

### Internal pre-conditions

- User deposits in Borrowing contract
- User withdraws from Borrowing contract

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User deposits in Borrowing contract
2. User withdraws from Borrowing contract
3. Treasury::withdraw is called in `BorrowLib::withdraw` which contains the incorrect require statement
4. Transaction always reverts in "Already withdrawn"

### Impact

- User funds are locked since they can not withdraw due to the revert "Already withdrawn"

### PoC

Can not be created since the `BorrowLib::withdraw` function reverts in underflow before the call to the `Treasury::withdraw`. Bug in `BorrowLib::withdraw` already reported. PoC would require altering the original code.

### Mitigation

In `Treasury::withdraw` change the require statement to check depositDetails.withdrawed is false instead of true.

```diff
function withdraw(
        address borrower,
        address toAddress,
        uint256 amount,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 index
    ) external payable onlyCoreContracts returns (bool) {
        // Check the _amount is non zero
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw zero collateral");
        if (toAddress == address(0)) revert Treasury_ZeroAddress();
        // Get the borrower deposit details
        DepositDetails memory depositDetails = borrowing[borrower].depositDetails[index];
        // check the deposit alredy withdrew or not
-       require(depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
+       require(!depositDetails.withdrawed, "Already withdrawn");
```
