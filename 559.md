# Issue in Updating `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` during CDS Withdrawals

### Summary

The `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` variable is designed to represent the total amount available for liquidation across users. However, it is not updated correctly during user withdrawals, leading to discrepancies in share calculations. Specifically, when users withdraw their entire deposit (including their set liquidation amount), the liquidation amount is not deducted from `totalAvailableLiquidationAmount`. This causes downstream issues in the share calculation logic for liquidation operations.

### Root Cause

The issue arises due to the improper handling of the `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` during cds withdrawal operations. Specifically:

When a user withdraws their deposit, the liquidation amount they set is also withdrawn.
The `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` is updated without adequately removing the liquidation amount set by the user.
This results in an overestimation of the available liquidation amount (`liquidationData.availableLiquidationAmount`), which negatively affects share calculations.

as the `liquidationData.availableLiquidationAmount` is set to `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` during liquidation

### Attack Path

in CDS Withdrawal Process:

A user deposits funds (e.g., 200) and sets a liquidation amount (e.g., 100).
They later withdraw their entire deposit, causing `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` to increase by 100 during deposit and not properly decrease during withdrawal.
Liquidation Process:

The inflated `omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount` value is used in the denominator during share calculations:

This results in smaller shares for stakeholders, diminishing their rightful distribution during liquidation.
Potential Exploit:

An attacker can repeatedly deposit and withdraw funds while setting high liquidation amounts, artificially inflating totalAvailableLiquidationAmount and reducing the effective shares during liquidation for legitimate stakeholders.

### Impact

1. Financial Loss for Stakeholders:
Stakeholders receive fewer shares during liquidation than they are entitled to.

2. Denial of Fair Liquidation Proceeds:
Legitimate participants may lose trust in the system due to disproportionate share allocation.

3. Potential for Abuse:
An attacker could exploit this flaw to degrade the system's integrity and fairness.

### Mitigation

add to the withdrawalfunction
```solidity
omniChainData.totalAvailableLiquidationAmount -= params.cdsDepositDetails.liquidationAmount;
```
