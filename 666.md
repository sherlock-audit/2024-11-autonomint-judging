# Manipulating Consecutive Deposits to Exploit Protocol Funds

### Summary

The issue lies in the ``lastEthPrice`` variable not being updated after every deposits, which can lead to incorrect profit and loss calculations. This oversight can cause inflated or deflated ``netPLCdsPool`` values, resulting in erroneous internal accounting, fund loss, and potential exploitation.

### Root Cause

The ``lastEthPrice`` variable is not updated in ``borrowing.sol::deposit`` after each deposit, allowing it to remain static while deposits are processed at the current ETH price (``currentEthPrice```).

### Internal pre-conditions

- `lastEthPrice` has been set at an earlier time.
- No withdrawals occur to trigger an update to `lastEthPrice`.
- Deposits are processed consecutively with the same `currentEthPrice`.


### External pre-conditions

- The ETH price remains stable during the series of deposits.
- The total collateral amount (`totalCollateralInETH`) is non-zero.
- Attackers or users can perform multiple small deposits.


### Attack Path

**Setup Initial Conditions**:
1. Set ``lastEthPrice`` = 200.
2. The total collateral (``totalCollateralInETH``) is set to 500.
**Execute Consecutive Deposits**:
1. Current ETH price (`currentEthPrice`) is 210 for all deposits.
2. A user performs 50 small deposits without triggering a withdrawal.
**Observe Net Profit/Loss Miscalculation**:
1. For each deposit:
$$netPLCdsPool = (currentEthPrice - lastEthPrice) * totalCollateralInETH$$ 
$$netPLCdsPool = (210 - 200) * 500 = 5000.$$  
2. The ``cdsPoolValue`` increases incorrectly by 5000 after each deposit, despite the ETH price remaining constant.


### Impact

1. **First Withdrawer Gains Excessive Profits**:

They withdraw inflated profits derived from the miscalculated ``cdsPoolValue``.
2. **Losses for Later Withdrawers**:

Later users may face fund shortages or overestimated losses.
3. **Protocol Stability**:

4. **DoS Risk**:

The last withdrawer may be unable to withdraw funds due to discrepancies in ``cdsPoolValue``.

### PoC

**Initial Setup**:
- ``lastEthPrice`` = 200.
- ``currentEthPrice`` = 210.
- ``totalCollateralInETH`` = 500.
**Deposit Simulation**:

Perform 50 deposits at ``currentEthPrice`` = 210.
Observe ``cdsPoolValue`` increase by 5000 after each deposit, despite no actual profit or loss occurring.
**Withdrawal Exploit**:
Immediately withdraw funds after the deposits to collect the inflated profits.


### Mitigation

Update ``lastEthPrice`` after each deposit in the ``borrowing.sol::deposit`` function.
```solidity
function deposit(...) public {  
    // Existing logic  

    // Update the lastEthPrice after the deposit  
    lastEthPrice = currentEthPrice;  
}  
```
