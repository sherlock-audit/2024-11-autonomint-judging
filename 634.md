# Lack of access control for executeSetterFunction function.

### Summary

Lack of access control for executeSetterFunction() function. Anyone can trigger this function to clear current approvals.

### Root Cause

In [multiSign.sol:executeSetterFunction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304), admin needs to execute the setter function before admin sets some key parameters. After we execute the setter function, the previous approved will be cleared.

The problem is that we lack access control for executeSetterFunction function. When owners approve for one set function, anyone can trigger executeSetterFunction() function directly to clear the existing approval. This will cause admin's executeSetterFunction() reverted.

For example:
1. Owners approve SetLTV function, and we reach the requiredApprovals.
2. Malicious user monitors the approval events, triggers executeSetterFunction() function to clear the approvals.
3. Admin in borrowing.sol triggers `setLTV`, this transaction will be reverted because the approvals for this have been cleared.

```solidity
    function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
    ) external returns (bool) {
        require(getSetterFunctionApproval(_function) >= requiredApprovals,"Required approvals not met");
        for (uint64 i; i < noOfOwners; i++) {
            approvedToUpdate[_function][owners[i]] = false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Owners approve SetLTV function, and we reach the requiredApprovals.
2. Malicious user monitors the approval events, triggers executeSetterFunction() function to clear the approvals.
3. Admin in borrowing.sol triggers `setLTV`, this transaction will be reverted because the approvals for this have been cleared.


### Impact

Malicious users can trigger executeSetterFunction() function to clear the approvals. This will block admin set some key parameters, e.g. setLTV().

### Mitigation

Add access control for function `executeSetterFunction`.
