# Cross-Chain Double-Spend Vulnerability in CDS Protocol Deposit System

## Summary
The CDS contract's deposit mechanism implements a flawed cross-chain state synchronization pattern where state mutations precede cross-chain message confirmation. This architectural design breaks atomicity guarantees for cross-chain deposits and creates a critical state synchronization vulnerability.

At the core of this issue lies the deposit() function's execution flow, where local state variables including balances, counts and deposited amounts are committed before the LayerZero cross-chain message is sent and confirmed. Without transactional atomicity between local state changes and cross-chain communication, an attacker can exploit failed cross-chain messages to create state divergence between chains.

This synchronization flaw enables malicious actors to deliberately fail cross-chain messages through insufficient gas allocation or LayerZero exploits, resulting in permanently diverged protocol state. Through strategic withdrawals on different chains where balances are desynchronized, attackers can effectively double-spend deposits and drain protocol liquidity.

The high severity impact stems from both the direct theft of user funds through double-spending and the broader protocol insolvency risk from cumulative state inconsistencies.

## Proof of Concept

Initial Setup:
- CDS protocol deployed on Chain A and Chain B
- Attacker has 100,000 USDT
- Protocol requires cross-chain synchronization of deposit states

Attack Path:
1. Attacker initiates deposit of 100,000 USDT on Chain A with carefully calculated gas limit
   - Local state updates complete successfully
   - Cross-chain message to Chain B fails due to insufficient gas

2. At this point:
   - Chain A records: Attacker deposited 100,000 USDT
   - Chain B remains unaware of deposit
   - Tokens are transferred to protocol on Chain A

3. Attacker initiates withdrawal on Chain B
   - Since Chain B never received deposit notification
   - Withdrawal succeeds as state shows no existing deposit

4. Attacker also withdraws on Chain A
   - Original deposit record exists
   - Withdrawal succeeds normally

Result:
- Single 100,000 USDT deposit
- Two successful withdrawals
- Net gain: 100,000 USDT stolen from protocol
- State permanently desynced between chains

This cycle can be repeated until protocol liquidity is drained or inconsistency is detected.

```solidity
function deposit(...) public payable nonReentrant {
    // Critical: State mutations occur before cross-chain message
    usdtAmountDepositedTillNow = result.usdtAmountDepositedTillNow;
    totalCdsDepositedAmount = result.totalCdsDepositedAmount;
    
    // Cross-chain message can fail after state is committed
    globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(
        IGlobalVariables.FunctionToDo(1),
        IBorrowing.AssetName(0),
        fee,
        _options,
        msg.sender
    );
}
```

## Recommended mitigation steps
The core mitigation requires implementing proper transactional atomicity through a two-phase commit pattern:

```solidity
function deposit(...) public payable nonReentrant {
    bytes32 depositId = keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, block.number, usdtAmount, usdaAmount));
    
    _lockDeposit(msg.sender, usdtAmount, usdaAmount);
    
    try globalVariables.send{value: fee.nativeFee}(...) {
        emit DepositInitiated(depositId, msg.sender, usdtAmount, usdaAmount);
    } catch {
        _unlockDeposit(msg.sender, usdtAmount, usdaAmount);
        revert("Cross-chain message failed");
    }
}

function confirmDeposit(bytes32 depositId) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(globalVariables), "Only global variables");
    
    PendingDeposit memory deposit = pendingDeposits[depositId];
    _finalizeDeposit(deposit);
    delete pendingDeposits[depositId];
}
```

This pattern ensures deposits are only finalized after successful cross-chain confirmation. Additional rollback capabilities, deposit timeout mechanisms, and comprehensive event monitoring should be implemented to handle edge cases and maintain protocol state consistency.
