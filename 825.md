# There is a potential underflow in `BorrowLib.calculateCollateralToReturn()` which gets called when a user withdraws collateral and borrow is above the healthy treshold, which will lead to reverts.

### Summary

In `BorrowLib.sol`, the `calculateCollateralToReturn()` function can experience underflow when calculating remaining collateral during withdrawals. When strike price gains push the return amount above the original deposit amount, the subtraction operation underflows, which will lead to reverts when users try to withdraw collateral that has gains.

### Root Cause

In [`BorrowLib.sol:472`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L472-L516), the calculation of remaining collateral doesn't account for cases where strike gains make the return amount larger than the original deposit:

```solidity
collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
        params.ethPrice
    ));
    
    // Underflows if collateralToReturn > depositedAmountInETH
    collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralToReturn;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has an active deposit position
2. Total return amount (deposit + gains) exceeds original deposit

### External pre-conditions

1.ETH price movement creates strike price gains

### Attack Path

1. Initial setup:
- User deposits 10 ETH
- depositedAmountInETH = 10 ETH

2. Price movement creates gains:
- strikeGains = 3 ETH
- collateralToReturn = 10 ETH + 3 ETH = 13 ETH

3. Underflow occurs and Withdrawal attempt reverts:
remaining = 10 ether - 13 ether  // Underflows

### Impact

1. Functional Issues:
  - Users cannot withdraw when they have significant gains
  - Funds become temporarily locked
  - Protocol functionality breaks in profitable scenarios
2. User Experience:
  - Withdrawals fail when they should succeed
  - Users cannot access their rightful profits
  - Contradicts protocol's intended behavior

### PoC

### Mitigation

1. Implement proper handling of gains:

```solidity
function calculateCollateralToReturn(...) {
    uint256 totalReturn = depositedAmountvalue + strikeGains;
    
    // Set remaining to 0 when there are gains
    if (totalReturn > params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH) {
        collateralRemainingInWithdraw = 0;
    } else {
        collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - totalReturn;
    }
    
    // Update state variables
    params.collateralRemainingInWithdraw += collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
    params.omniChainData.collateralRemainingInWithdraw += collateralRemainingInWithdraw;
}
```

2. Track gains separately from principal
3. Add explicit handling for profit scenarios
4. Consider implementing a different accounting system for gains
