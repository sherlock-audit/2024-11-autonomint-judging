# Missing Validations in Redstone Oracle Integration: Heartbeat Interval and Zero-Price Checks in `MasterPriceOracle`

## Summary  
The protocol utilizes Redstone Oracles to fetch pricing data for underlying assets and ETH. However, the current integration lacks vital safety checks, specifically for validating the heartbeat interval and ensuring prices are greater than zero. These missing checks can lead to the acceptance of outdated or zero prices, which could compromise price accuracy and lead to potential financial losses. The issue is found in the [implementation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/oracles/MasterPriceOracle.sol#L63C13-L78C108). 
The protocol must check the heartbeat interval mentioned here in [Redstone Feeds](https://app.redstone.finance/app/feeds/) to ensure no stale price is return. so should never allow zero-prices.

To ensure proper functioning, the protocol should incorporate checks for the heartbeat interval, ensuring no stale prices are accepted. Additionally, the implementation must reject zero-price values to safeguard against invalid price calculations.

## Root Cause  
The core issue arises from the lack of validation for both the heartbeat interval and the price being greater than zero within the Redstone Oracle integration. Without these checks, the protocol is susceptible to using outdated or incorrect price data, potentially leading to faulty calculations.

## Internal Preconditions  
## External Preconditions  

## Attack Path  
1. A Redstone Oracle may return a stale price if there are delays in price updates or network issues, and the protocol does not validate the freshness of the data.  
2. The protocol may inadvertently accept a zero-price from the oracle, allowing invalid price data to be used in subsequent operations, leading to incorrect financial actions and potential exploits.

## Impact  
- **Financial Loss**: Operations based on outdated or zero-price data could result in improper fund allocation or payouts, leading to potential financial losses.  
- **Exploitation Risk**: Malicious actors could take advantage of stale or zero prices, manipulating the protocol for financial gain.  
- **Trust Degradation**: Continued reliance on inaccurate price feeds could erode user trust in the protocol, deterring adoption and usage.

## Mitigation  
Implement validation checks to compare the heartbeat interval against the timestamp of the last update. Additionally, enforce validation to ensure the oracle price is greater than zero before accepting it for further use.
