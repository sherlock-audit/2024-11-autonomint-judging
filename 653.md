# `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` requires too much fees

### Summary

The `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` function of GlobalVariables allows for assets to be requested from the other chain. It is called in CDSLib.withdrawUser in order to request collateral and USDa from the other chain. The issue is that in that scenario too much gas fees are requested for the execution on the destination chain.

### Root Cause

In GlobalVariables.oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains:300 the requried fees are:

```solidity
uint128(5 * feeForTokenTransfer.nativeFee + (feeForCollateralTransfer.nativeFee - collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend)),
```

The issue is that it requests 5 times of the token transfer native fee even though only 3 OFT assets can be requested: USDa, weETH and rsETH. The correct implementation should only require 3 times of the token transfer native fee.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User withdraws from CDS, however, collateral and option fees are requested from the other chain.
2. User provides sufficient `msg.value` for the transfer of 3 OFT tokens, however, `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` requires more and the call reverts.

### Impact

Users must provide more ETH than necessary.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `oftOrCollateralReceiveFromOtherChains` to only require fees for 3 OFT tokens:
```solidity
uint128(3 * feeForTokenTransfer.nativeFee + (feeForCollateralTransfer.nativeFee - collateralTokenTransferData.ethToSend)),
```
