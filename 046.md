# Users can renew their position after liquidation period

### Summary

Incorrect time validation in `getOptionFeesToPay`

### Root Cause

Lets assume liquidation is being implemented for expired positions in protocol, which is not for now. Users will be able to avoid being liquidated by calling renewOptions AFTER its position expired

`IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed` is incorrect and never validate correctly any time
`time < optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days && time > optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days`
```solidity
    function getOptionFeesToPay(
        ITreasury treasury,
        uint64 index
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
...
            // check the user is eligible to renew position
->            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
                block.timestamp >
                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();

-                block.timestamp <
-                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 15 days &&
-                block.timestamp >
-                depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
-            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();

+            if ( block.timestamp > depositDetail.optionsRenewedTimeStamp + 30 days
+            ) revert IBorrowing.Borrow_DeadlinePassed();
