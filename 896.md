# Users may be unable to withdraw their collateral when the price of ETH increases

### Summary

When users withdraw from borrowing.sol the amount of collateral they have to receive is calculated through the calculateCollateralToReturn function. The issue is that it is possible for the function to revert even when valid withdrawal data has been provided, preventing users from withdrawing their collateral.

### Root Cause

In BorrowLib.calculateCollateralToReturn the following calculation is performed:

```solidity
        if (params.borrowingHealth > 10000) {
            // If the ethPrice is higher than deposit ethPrice,call withdrawOption in options contract
            collateralToReturn = (depositedAmountvalue + params.options.calculateStrikePriceGains(
                        params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH,
                        params.depositDetail.strikePrice,
                        params.ethPrice
                    )
                );
            // increment the difference between collatearla to  return and deposited amount in collateralRemainingInWithdraw
            collateralRemainingInWithdraw = params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH - collateralToReturn;
```

After that `collateralRemainingInWithdraw` is deducted from 50% of `params.depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH`:

The issue is that it is highly possible for the remaining collateral to be higher than the half of the deposited ETH if the price of ETH experiences large increases. If that happens the call will underflow, preventing the withdrawal from being finalized.

### Attack Path

1. User makes a deposit to borrowing.sol.
2. At the time of which they send the transaction the price of ETH is 2000 USD and they set the strikePrice to 3950 USD.
3. ETH's price continues to grow and reaches 4000 USD.
4. The user attempts to withdraw, however they are unable to as `calculateCollateralToReturn` reverts.

In the PoC a coded explanation is provided, illustrating why the revert happens.

### Impact

Users will be unable to withdraw their collateral if the price of ETH experiences large increases.

### PoC

This is a simple function that shows why the calculations in `calculateCollateralToReturn` will revert in the Attack Path provided above:

```solidity
    function testCollateralToReturnMath() public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 depositAmount = 1000e18;
        uint256 ethPriceAtDeposit = 2000e2;
        uint256 strikePrice = 3950e2;
        uint256 ethPriceAtWithdrawal = 4000e2;

        uint256 a = ((depositAmount * ethPriceAtDeposit) /
            ethPriceAtWithdrawal) +
            (depositAmount * ethPriceAtWithdrawal - depositAmount * strikePrice) /
            ethPriceAtWithdrawal;
        return a; //the result is 512500000000000000000 = 512e18
        //this will cause calculateCollateralToReturn to revert because 
        //50% of the depositAmount is 500e18 < 512e18, causing an underflow here: 
        //https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/0d324e04d4c0ca306e1ae4d4c65f0cb9d681751b/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/BorrowLib.sol#L509
    }
```

### Mitigation

Fix is non-trivial, `calculateCollateralToReturn` should be able to handle situations where the price of ETH experiences large increases.
