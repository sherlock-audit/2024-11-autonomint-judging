# Ethers will be locked in external protocol if the position is liquidated by liquidation type 2

### Summary

Missing withdraw Ether from the external protocol in liquidation type 2 will cause that some Ethers will be locked in the external protocol.

### Root Cause

When borrowers borrow USDa via collateral Ether, we will send half of the collateral to the external protocol. These Ethers will be withdrawn from the external protocol in below 2 scenario:
1. Abond users redeem yield to [withdraw from the external protocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/Treasury.sol#L283).
2. Admin liquidates one borrow position via liquidation type 1. The liquidated position's collateral in the external protocol will be withdrawn.

The problem is that if one position is liquidated by liquidation type 2, we miss withdrawing this liquidated borrow position's collateral in the external protocol. These collateral will be locked in the external protocol.

```solidity
    function withdrawFromExternalProtocol(
        address user,
        uint128 aBondAmount
    ) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
        if (user == address(0)) revert Treasury_ZeroAddress();
        uint256 redeemAmount = withdrawFromIonicByUser(user, aBondAmount);
        (bool sent, ) = payable(user).call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        return redeemAmount;
    }
    function withdrawFromExternalProtocolDuringLiq(
        address user,
        uint64 index
    ) external onlyCoreContracts returns (uint256) {
        // Calculate the current cumulative rate

        uint256 balanceBeforeWithdraw = address(this).balance;

        // Withdraw from external protocols
        uint256 redeemAmount = withdrawFromIonicDuringLiq(user, index);

        if (address(this).balance < redeemAmount + balanceBeforeWithdraw) revert Treasury_WithdrawExternalProtocolDuringLiqFailed();
        return (redeemAmount - (borrowing[user].depositDetails[index].depositedAmount * 50) / 100);
    }
