# Unordered LayerZero cross-chain messages can cause issues

### Summary

The absence of a monotonic nonce check in GlobalVariables.sol will cause an unintended rollback of newer global state to a stale state.

### Root Cause

In GlobalVariables.sol:_lzReceive(...) at  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/Core_logic/GlobalVariables.sol#L638 the code directly overwrites omniChainData and s_collateralData[oappData.assetName] without verifying that the incoming message is the latest. There is no sequence or timestamp check.


According to Layerzero docs default behavior of Layerzero doesnot guarantee ordered messages delivery and ordered execution option is not used.
`
OrderedExecution Option
By adding this option, the Executor will utilize Ordered Message Delivery. This overrides the default behavior of Unordered Message Delivery
`

### Attack Path

- Chain A sends Message 1 with “totalCdsDepositedAmount = 100” (the older state).
- Chain A shortly after sends Message 2 with “totalCdsDepositedAmount = 200” (the newer state).
- Due to network or malicious interference, Message 2 arrives first on Chain B, setting the final state to 200.
- Later, Message 1 arrives out-of-order on Chain B, overwriting the final state to 100.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a rollback to stale on-chain data for deposit and liquidation calculations.Potentially, this can lead to:

Over-or-under liquidation events,
Double-claiming or mis-accounting for cross-chain deposits,
Arbitrary mismatches in totalCdsDepositedAmount, harming user positions.
