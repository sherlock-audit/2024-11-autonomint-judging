# CDS.updateDownsideProtected can be called by anyone

### Summary

The `updateDownsideProtected` is missing any access validation, enabling malicious users to artifcially increase `downsideProtected `. The `downsideProtected` variable is a critical part of the protocol and manipulating it can be detrimental.

### Root Cause

In CDS.updateDownsideProtected there are no access-control modifiers implemented:

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

As the `downsideProtected` variable is used in numerous parts of the protocol, increasing it in order to reach `type(uint256).max` will brick most functionalities of the protocol, for example:
1. Malicious user calls `updateDownsideProtected` and increases `downsideProtected` to `type(uint256).max` 
2. Now users cannot deposit into CDS as `_updateCurrentTotalCdsDepositedAmount` will revert here:

Users will also be prevented from both depositing and withdrawing from both CDS and the borrowing contract.

### Impact

Malicious users can brick most of the protcol's functionalities.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`updateDownsideProtected` should only be callable by the borrowing contract.
