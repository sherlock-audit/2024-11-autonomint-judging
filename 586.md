# `CDS::withdraw` will be reverted because of insufficient rsETH balance

### Summary
`CDS::withdraw` will be reverted because of insufficient rsETH balance

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-autonomint/blob/main/Blockchain/Blockchian/contracts/lib/CDSLib.sol#L355

### PoC
let's assume totalAmountNeededInETH is 1 ETH
ethAvailable = 0.5 ETH
weETHAvailable = 0.3 weETH
rsETHAvailable = 0.1 rsETH

liquidatedCollateralToGiveInWeETH = 1 ETH - 0.5 ETH = 0.5 ETH
liquidatedCollateralToGiveInWeETH = 0.5 weETH > 0.3 weETH = 0.3 weETH
liquidatedCollateralToGiveInRsETH = 1 ETH - 0.5 ETH - [03 ETH](0.3 weETH * weETHExRate) = 0.2 rsETH

as we can see liquidatedCollateralToGiveInRsETH is greater than rsETHAvailable and this causes transaction will be reverted and finally just 0.1 rsETH will be got from other chain and 0.2rsETH + 0.1 rsETH will be sent to user but just 0.2 rsETH exists in this chain

### Impact
break core funnctions
