# Insufficient Liquidation Criteria Creating Potential Bad Debt

### Summary

The liquidateBorrowPosition function relies solely on ETH price decline to determine liquidation eligibility. If the ETH price remains stable while the borrower’s debt grows due to accumulating interest, the debt can surpass the collateral value without triggering liquidation. This creates a risk of uncollectable debt for the protocol.

### Root Cause

 If collateral price stays stable for a long time or drops to critical levels (%18-19) users dept could be higher than the collateral amount.  The `liquidateBorrowPosition` function checks only the ETH price ratio against the collateral value, ignoring the growing debt due to unpaid interest. So this position cant be liquidated and borrower doesn't have any reason to pay this position. This would create a  potential bad dept for the protocol.


```solidity
  function liquidationType1(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice,
        uint256 lastCumulativeRate
    ) internal returns (CDSInterface.LiquidationInfo memory liquidationInfo) {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        // Check whether the position is already liquidated or not
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");

        // Get the exchange rate and ETH price
        (uint128 exchangeRate /*uint128 ethPrice*/, ) = borrowing.getUSDValue(borrowing.assetAddress(depositDetail.assetName));

        // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000,"You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A borrower doesn't repay debt while ETH price remains stable.
2. The debt accumulates, surpassing the collateral value.
3. The position cannot be liquidated due to the protocol’s ETH price-only check.
4. The 20% drop threshold prevents liquidation despite insufficient collateral.

### Impact

The protocol accrues uncollectable debt
Borrowers could exploit this by delaying repayment until the price increases and they profit.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Introduce a debt-to-collateral ratio check that includes accrued interest.
