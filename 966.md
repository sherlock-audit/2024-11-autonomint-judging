# DoS in Liquidation type 2

### Summary

The `BorrowLiquidation` contract does not ensure it holds the required `amount` of ETH before invoking the `weth.deposit` function during type 2 liquidation, resulting in transaction failures. Due to this Liquidation type 2 will never will be fully executed.

### Root Cause

In the `liquidationType2` function, the contract attempts to convert ETH to WETH using `weth.deposit{value: amount}()`. However, the `BorrowLiquidation` contract does not retain the necessary ETH balance, leading to the `weth.deposit` failure.

This is failing because as per the logic, that particular calculated `amount` of ETH was supposed to be first taken from treasury, but here they missed it. (Sponser confirmed)

`uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);`

```solidity
    function liquidationType2(
        address user,
        uint64 index,
        uint64 currentEthPrice
    ) internal {
        // Get the borrower and deposit details
        ITreasury.GetBorrowingResult memory getBorrowingResult = treasury.getBorrowing(user, index);
        ITreasury.DepositDetails memory depositDetail = getBorrowingResult.depositDetails;
        require(!depositDetail.liquidated, "Already Liquidated");

        // Check whether the position is eligible for liquidation
        uint128 ratio = BorrowLib.calculateEthPriceRatio(depositDetail.ethPriceAtDeposit, currentEthPrice);
        require(ratio <= 8000, "You cannot liquidate, ratio is greater than 0.8");

        uint256 amount = BorrowLib.calculateHalfValue(depositDetail.depositedAmountInETH);

        // Convert the ETH into WETH
  @->>      weth.deposit{value: amount}();
        // Approve it, to mint sETH
        bool approved = weth.approve(address(wrapper), amount);

### Impact

- Admin will never be able to liquidate user from type2 liquidations. 
- Lead to financial losses for the protocol due to unliquidated risky positions.


### PoC

### Mitigation

Ensure the required ETH is retrieved from `treasury.sol` before invoking the `deposit` function of the WETH contract.
