# Missing L2 Sequencer Status Validation in MasterPriceOracle Could Lead to Stale Prices When Sequencer is Down

## Summary
The `MasterPriceOracle` contract on Optimism (chainId 10) does not validate the L2 sequencer status before using Chainlink price feeds. If the sequencer is down, the protocol could operate with stale prices that appear fresh.

## Vulnerability Details
The `_price()` function retrieves Chainlink oracle prices on Optimism without checking if the L2 sequencer is operational:

When the L2 sequencer is down:
1. No new price updates can be posted on L2
2. The existing price feed continues to appear fresh
3. Users can continue to interact with the protocol using outdated prices

## Impact

If the sequencer goes down and oracle data becomes stale, code will execute with prices that don't reflect the current market prices. This could lead to immediate financial losses as oracle data will not be kept up to date, resulting in incorrect valuations for borrowing and liquidations that directly impact user funds. The protocol would continue operating with incorrect prices until the sequencer is back up or fresh oracle data is available, potentially leading to significant losses for both users and the protocol.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Chainlinkâ€™s official documentation provides an implementation of checking L2 sequencers.
